/// Load every expected sector of an existing trusted-local generation campaign
/// into one experimental concrete reducer, without solving or re-encoding.
///
/// Every requested sector must be saved: explicit selected-sector completion
/// does not mean completion of the entire root downset.
/// Requires `request.checkpoint` with explicit `resume = true`, an installed
/// manifest and cooperative lock file, and the complete expected set of stored
/// sector records.
/// Holds that lock while reading; neither shards, manifest nor lock are created
/// or modified. Missing/invalid sectors fail rather than being regenerated.
/// Request source, root, ordering, rank, finite-case policy, backend and recipe
/// must match. Worker count is unused: no sector executor is constructed.
///
/// `request.bundle_limits` bounds each shard (at most 1 GiB), cumulative program
/// collection entries, cumulative coefficient-table entries and cumulative
/// coefficient-table bytes, counting repeated local dictionaries conservatively.
/// All those cumulative checks precede any native shard import. Native state
/// bytes remain individually bounded by the existing binary codec and globally
/// by `checkpoint.max_total_bytes`, which also counts all directory payloads.
/// These bounds are not peak-RSS guarantees: the existing reducer retains all
/// rules and explicit terminals in memory. There is no large monolithic buffer.
///
/// As for [`super::load_generated_candidate_bundle`], native Symbolica payloads
/// require trusted matching-stack provenance. This is storage/structure
/// admission, not source replay, recursive closure or master independence.
/// Above-entry-rank successors remain internal to the same reducer and are
/// never clipped or re-admitted as independent public entry targets.
