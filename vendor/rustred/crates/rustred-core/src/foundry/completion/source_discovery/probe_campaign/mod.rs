//! One-task semantic adapter from frozen probe geometry to an exact owner-cover
//! delta.
//!
//! The direct one-task adapter consumes an immutable interior- or
//! boundary-simplex plan, completed ordinary source module, and canonical
//! sector ledger. This module validates the task against its originating planner
//! epoch and exact parent box, derives a fresh maximal anchor, streams the
//! scheduler result through exact replay, and transactionally submits any
//! compiled owner to the ledger. Only an exact compiler `Closed` status is
//! exposed as closure; every other result remains discovery or cover-delta
//! telemetry.
