//! Transactional bottom-up publication of one same-rank sector wave.
//!
//! This coordinator accepts only pointer-paired executable owners produced by
//! canonical replay. It never adapts legacy `RuleCell`s into publication
//! authority. Every declared sector is compiled against one strongly retained
//! predecessor snapshot; if any cover is incomplete, no cover is sealed and no
//! layer enters a successor snapshot.
