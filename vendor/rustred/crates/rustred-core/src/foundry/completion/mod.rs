//! Exact geometric state for sector-wide rule completion.
//!
//! A fixed sector is charted by nonnegative coordinates: active powers use
//! `x_i = n_i - 1`, while inactive powers use `x_i = -n_i`.  A symbolic rule
//! whose leading coordinate is nonnegative covers an upward orthant on the
//! current domain stratum.  [`LeadingIdeal`] keeps the minimal leading
//! antichain, and [`UncoveredPartition`] represents its complement exactly as
//! disjoint boxes, including unbounded axes and faces.
//!
//! The engine is crate-private production code during Stage 1.  Discovery
//! evidence never gains closure authority by existing: exact source replay,
//! strict descent, guard-stratum refinement, immutable lower-sector ownership,
//! and an independently compiled owner cover remain mandatory promotion
//! boundaries.
//! [`SectorChart`] maps only the `i64` carrier.  No carrier endpoint is treated
//! as mathematical infinity without a separate asymptotic-extension witness.
