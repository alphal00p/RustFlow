//! Deterministic guarded owner covers built from replayed exact circuits.
//!
//! A semantic DAG owns an exact box/cylinder only when every abstract guard
//! branch selects an exact circuit, or exact locus analysis proves one ordered
//! candidate applicable throughout it, and every retained right-hand side is
//! rechecked to descend in the common sector order. Partial DAGs may still own
//! individually enumerated points after exact guard evaluation. Every other
//! finite point needs an explicit terminal declaration; an unbounded residue
//! or a reachable guard-incomplete ray remains a typed obstruction.
