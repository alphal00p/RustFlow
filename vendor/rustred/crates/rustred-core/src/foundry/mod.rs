//! Offline derivation of proof-bearing integral rules.
//!
//! [`anchored`] derives exact rules at one concrete integer anchor, while
//! [`parametric`] derives exactly replayed recurrences on a fixed-sector
//! interior and replays them directly in the exact base field. Both
//! foundries offer their original forward-selected rule and a target-directed
//! serial-RREF path. The parametric target path can also prove a recurrence on
//! a sector-monotone parent box, retaining every pinch cylinder as an explicit
//! unresolved proper-subsector dependency.
//! [`search`] plans complete, bounded same-sector L1 translation diamonds and
//! exact finite RuleCell reachability censuses; it owns no topology or
//! elimination logic, and neither search certifies an infinite domain.
//! [`artifact`] generates and seals the canonical unit-mass `K = 1` tadpole
//! and `K = 3` sunset partitions, and [`crate::reduction`] applies either
//! sealed owner through a topology-independent runtime. A fully published
//! three-loop `K = 6` wave campaign now has an in-memory installation seam;
//! obtaining that complete wave chain and registering its durable grammar
//! remain explicit Stage 1 frontiers.
