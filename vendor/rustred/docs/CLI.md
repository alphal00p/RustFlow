# RustRed command-line interface

`rustred derive` is the human-facing entry point for RustRed's generic
LiteRed-like derivation layer. It constructs an exact affine integral family
with Symbolica and emits the complete fully parametric ordinary IBP and
Lorentz-invariance identities. It does not choose sectors, masters, special
recurrences, or reduce a concrete target.

The CLI never invokes FORM. The RustRed crate and binary use Symbolica's GMP
backend; there is no `no_gmp` mode.

## Shared saved-owner dependency campaign

For an opt-in dynamic queue across starting topologies, with the existing
parallel scheduler retained inside each job, see
[independent campaigns](independent_owner_campaigns.md). Native commands are
`campaign shards --config PATH --directory DIR`,
`campaign shards --directory DIR --resume`, and the read-only
`campaign monitor --directory DIR [--once|--json]`. The existing shared mode
and its defaults remain unchanged.

`rustred owner-domain-scan` inventories possible parametric successors of saved
rules without enumerating positive powers or generating IBPs. Its bounded,
Python-steerable report retains actual intermediate-rank requirements but is
not a recursive closure result or a proven missing-rule list; see
[the domain-scan interface](owner_domain_scan.md).

`rustred routed-campaign` loads an externally supplied owner/routing manifest
once and follows a batch of concrete targets with a shared parallel work queue.
It reports uncovered rules/owners, resource failures and live progress rather
than regenerating saved IBPs. The standard-library Python driver adds process
and memory supervision, with no fixed short timeout. See the
[driver, input format and scope](shared_owner_campaign_driver.md).
This is finite dependency inspection, not complete parametric-family generation,
coefficient back-substitution or a resumable work cache.

Optional `--entry-domains DOMAINS.json` supplies a finite union in the existing
owner-domain query format. It replaces starting-root admission only, permitting
an explicitly requested scope distinct from saved rule-generation scope.
`--targets` still specifies the actual inputs; no exhaustive-domain coverage
or descendant truncation is implied. The Python supervisor forwards the same
option; see [the finite-domain contract](shared_owner_campaign_driver.md#explicit-finite-starting-domains).

### Optional application-cell refinement

`owner-domain-match --follow-successors` accepts
`--apply-cell-refinement-max-cardinality N` (positive integer, off when omitted).
After selecting a rule, this experimental policy splits an application cell
with exactly one varying coordinate, whose upper bound is finite (all other
coordinates fixed), into exact singleton cells when its cardinality is at most
`N`. It reuses the matched rule and its guards;
it does not repeat matching, add workers, or change the requested domain.
Ineligible cells use the existing path. All descendants remain obligations.

The Rust setting is `OwnerAppliedLimits::cell_refinement`, using
`OwnerAppliedCellRefinement::SingleFiniteAxis { max_cardinality }` or `Off`.
The Python campaign steering examples forward the same CLI option; this is
not a new installed `import rustred` method. The policy is bound into saved
checkpoints, so changing it requires a fresh campaign. `--unbounded-work`
does not change its eligibility threshold. Native application counters
`application_refinement_steps` and `application_refinement_cells` measure
per-shift-group refinement work, not extra logical completions.

This remains off by default pending recursive-workload measurements. A faster
local inspection can emit more successors and need not accelerate the campaign.

### Walk checkpoints (CP5)

`owner-domain-match --follow-successors --checkpoint DIR` saves the walk
state into an empty directory (`--checkpoint-interval-seconds`, default
3600, is stretched to twenty times the last save duration); `--resume DIR`
continues it and `--stop-file PATH` requests a cooperative save-and-pause
(exit 4). The directory holds a `latest.json`/`previous.json` manifest
(schema 5, `format: "RUSTRED-WALK-CP5"`) over generation-suffixed sections:
`meta-<G>.json`, `nodes-<G>.bin`, `ledger-<G>.bin` and `index-<G>.bin` are
rewritten each save; `domains-<S>.bin`, `edges-<S>.bin` and
`records-<S>.jsonl` are append-only segments tiling their section. Every
referenced file carries its byte length and blake3 digest and is verified
before decoding. The walk keeps at most one 64 KiB batch of committed
records in RAM: each record is serialized when it is committed and its
batch is appended to the open `records-<G>.jsonl`; the save of generation
`G` writes the last batch, seals that segment (fsync, digest) and an unsealed tail left
by a crash is ignored on resume and later removed by cleanup. The final
`result.json` streams its `domains` array from the segments one record at a
time (library callers: `OwnerDomainWalkResult::write_json` or
`into_document`; `document["domains"]` is `null` for checkpointed walks). Resume requires the same request/policy digest, owner
digests and executable `WALK_SEMANTICS_VERSION`; a different executable
digest with the same semantics version is accepted and reported. CP1-CP4
directories are refused; start a fresh campaign.

`rustred walk-semantics-version` is a read-only probe for launchers deciding
whether a paused checkpoint may resume on this executable. It takes no
options, opens no file, runs no algebra, prints one JSON line and exits 0:

```text
$ rustred walk-semantics-version
{"walk_semantics_version":1,"checkpoint_format":"RUSTRED-WALK-CP5","checkpoint_schema":5}
```

A resume on a different executable digest is compatible only when all three
values equal the saved manifest's `walk_semantics_version`, `format` and
`schema`. That is necessary, not sufficient: the native resume also requires
the manifest's request binding (inputs, limits including this executable's
default limits, and the `Debug` form of the reduction-limit, publication and
scheduling policies) to equal the new request's, and otherwise refuses with
`checkpoint request or policy differs; refusing to restart` before touching
the checkpoint. The probe does not report that binding, so a
performance-only change to those defaults or types stops existing
checkpoints from resuming even without a semantics bump. Executables built
before this probe exit 2 (unknown command); the production launcher's
`--upgrade-executable` refuses them unless the campaign's own executable
history lists them (a rollback;
[driver guide](shared_owner_campaign_driver.md#resuming-onto-a-semantics-compatible-binary)).

## Generic complete artifact generation

`rustred family-close` uses the family supplied in the input, not a built-in
family selector. By default it enumerates the full sector census, proves zero sectors
with the existing exact analyzer, and solves the remaining sectors. Durable
bytes are written only after the core replay, guard, strict-descent and complete
coverage gates succeed. An incomplete solver result is an error, not a partial
artifact. The concrete target in a Project input is validated but does not
restrict the family-wide closure request.

```console
rustred family-close --input YOUR_UNIT_MASS_FAMILY.toml \
  --input-format toml --n-cores 4 --output family.rr
rustred campaign inspect --artifact family.rr --output family.inspect.toml
rustred campaign reduce --artifact family.rr --powers 2,2,1
```

The existing core artifact producer currently admits unshifted vacuum families
with 1 through 16 denominator coordinates, dimension `d`, no other scalar
parameters, and literal constant term `-1` in every denominator. Normalize the
common mass before providing input; a denominator containing symbolic `m` is
not unit-mass input. A shared core admission check rejects incompatible families
before the sector census or solver runs, and the installer repeats that same
check at publication.
Accepted mathematical scope is separate from successful closure: challenging
families can still fail with exact incomplete/unsupported-domain diagnostics.

`--permutation 2,1,0` optionally supplies a zero-based coordinate priority used
coherently in every sector (here for a three-coordinate family). Every index
must appear exactly once. `--force` opts into
atomic replacement; otherwise existing output files are preserved.

### Explicit nonpositive coordinates

`--nonpositive-indices 8,9` explicitly restricts input coordinates 8 and 9 to
integer powers at most zero. This is useful for auxiliary scalar-product
coordinates: their numerator powers remain unbounded below. All other powers
remain unrestricted, and every sector and contraction in this declared domain
must still pass the complete closure gates. Indices are zero-based in the
original input order, independently of `--permutation`.

This is a domain declaration, not a finite sample or a list of convenient
sectors. The input target's zero powers never imply this restriction. Omitting
the option requests the unrestricted family. Duplicate or out-of-range indices
are errors. Scopes containing only zero sectors currently fail closed rather
than producing a zero-only artifact.

The artifact stores the domain, cold loading checks it, and reduction rejects
an out-of-domain target. Every published rule still proves strict descent and
valid RHS transitions. Globally proved zero sectors outside the domain remain
available as exact source-replay evidence; they do not expand the reduction
domain. Generation report schema v3 distinguishes `zero_sectors` (inside the
domain) from `global_zero_sectors` and records `root_sector`. Inspection schema
v3 exposes `root_power_lower`, `root_power_upper`, and `in_scope_zero_sectors`.
Its existing zero-terminal list includes the global proof evidence.

```console
rustred family-close --input examples/input/four_loop_fg.toml \
  --nonpositive-indices 8,9 --n-cores 2 --progress --output fg-physical.rr
```

This requests closure of the physical FG domain; it is not a claim that the
four-loop run already passes publication. See the
[current parent-probe evidence](four_loop_parent_closure_probe.md).

On a terminal, `family-close` and `family-candidates` use a bounded, overwriting
inline stderr dashboard with a colored header and a sector-generation progress
bar. They do not enter an alternate screen. An independent presenter refreshes
at most every 100 ms, including during a long solver phase with no new events.
Redirected stderr is quiet by default; add `--progress` to request plain,
newline-delimited snapshots at most once per second (plus final status), without
ANSI escapes:

```console
rustred family-close --input YOUR_UNIT_MASS_FAMILY.toml \
  --n-cores 4 --progress --output family.rr 2>family.progress.log
```

Worker progress may arrive out of order. The dashboard retains the latest
scalar event and coalesces intermediate details; it is **not a complete event
journal**. Generation, checkpoint reuse, checkpoint-save and failure counters
update before coalescing. Completed-sector rule/residual totals are separate
from live observed rule-hit counts. Frame/source/U/L/probe details come from the
latest available event, not an inferred view inside a silent algebra call.
Elapsed time, time since the latest event (`quiet`), and the latest job/phase
age remain visible during that silence. Case counts and pending queues do not
imply a completion percentage or ETA.

The bar uses generated plus reused sectors only after the prepared census
provides a denominator; otherwise it is indeterminate. Even a full bar means
sector generation, **not closure, certification, or durable output**. The
resource line reports current and peak **process** RSS on Linux, not combined
worker-process-tree memory or an enforced memory limit. Peak RSS is the OS
process-lifetime high-water mark. CPU utilization is explicitly unavailable;
active-worker utilization and reconstruction-cache statistics are not measured
by this dashboard. `NO_COLOR` disables terminal colors without disabling cursor
management.

Presentation, resource sampling and stderr I/O run outside solver callbacks.
Presentation failures never change the solve result. Final status flushes once
without waiting for the normal refresh interval; shutdown waits at most 500 ms
for a blocked presenter, with best-effort terminal cleanup if the writer later
unblocks. Progress never shares artifact stdout. The final `output written`
message is emitted only after output succeeds; an early drop reports output as
unconfirmed rather than claiming success. Use the Rust observation API below
when a complete per-event diagnostic record is needed.

The Rust application API exposes `FamilyCloseRequest`, `family_close`, and
`FamilyCloseResult`. The result owns durable bytes through `artifact()` and
`into_artifact()`, and a `to_toml()` report with preparation, generation,
installation and encoding wall times. Those timings are observational metadata,
not part of the semantic artifact. Existing inspect/reduce APIs cold-load and
apply the returned bytes without re-running discovery.
`FamilyCloseRequest::nonpositive_indices` declares the same optional domain;
Python exposes `rustred.family_close(..., nonpositive_indices=[8, 9])`.

`family_close_with_progress(request, observer)` produces identical artifact
bytes and exposes owned, lightweight `FamilyCloseProgress` events. Its observer
has type `Fn(FamilyCloseProgress) + Send + Sync`: generation callbacks can run
concurrently on sector workers, while installation callbacks run on the calling
thread. Keep callbacks short and synchronize any mutable observer state.
Sector masks use bit `i` for input denominator coordinate `i`; ordinals are
zero-based. No symbolic expressions are copied into progress. `family_close`
uses the unobserved path, avoiding renderer locking and application-event construction.

Live progress is currently exposed through the Rust application API and CLI.
Python's existing `rustred.family_close` still provides the same generation,
artifact and timing-report result; Python callbacks are deferred until their
interaction with the detached coordinator and GIL is designed and tested.

## Inspect saved candidate programs

Read trusted native candidate bundles without another generation or coverage
run:

```bash
rustred candidate-inspect --input saved.candidates.rrbin --output inspection.json
rustred candidate-inspect --input saved.candidates.rrbin \
  --options inspection-options.json --output detailed-inspection.json
```

For example, `inspection-options.json` can contain:

```json
{
  "rule_ordinals": [0, 1],
  "include_rhs_coefficients": true,
  "max_output_bytes": 16777216
}
```

Omit `rule_ordinals` to retain every rule. Optional `sectors` is a list of
original-coordinate Boolean masks. Rule ordinals are zero-based within each
selected sector; saved ordering is preserved. Invalid, empty or duplicate
filters fail explicitly. The report states omitted rule/sector/terminal counts.
By default it includes guard expressions and RHS coefficient IDs, but not RHS
coefficient expressions. IDs are local to one payload, never cross-file
algebraic identities. `max_output_bytes` bounds the diagnostic JSON, not import
peak memory; overflow fails instead of silently truncating a successful report.

The same operation is available as
`rustred_app::inspect_generated_candidate_program` in Rust and
`rustred.inspect_candidate_program(bundle_bytes, options_json=...)` in Python
(returning a JSON string). The small Rust example can be built separately with
`cargo build --release --locked -p rustred-app --example inspect_candidate_program`.

Integral coordinates always refer to the original denominators. Saved
`priority_slots` affect ordering, not coordinate labels. Applicability exclusions
are an OR of AND-branches: a rule is excluded if every polynomial in any one
branch vanishes. Ordered candidate cases are not disjoint dispatch cells;
earlier rules, source conditions, denominator poles, zero sectors and terminals
still govern application. Terminal keys are exact saved integers, not a claim
of a minimal basis. Symbolica expression strings here are for diagnosis only;
native binary persistence remains unchanged. No source-replay or closure claim
is established by inspection, and native bundles must be trusted inputs.

## Save candidates, certify independently

Use `family-candidates` when you want the solver's formulas even before global
artifact certification succeeds. It saves an explicitly **uncertified** bundle;
it does not perform original-source replay or prove family closure. A separate
`certify-candidates` invocation reconstructs those formulas and uses the existing
replay, guard, strict-descent, coverage and publication gates without repeating
the search.

```console
rustred family-candidates --input examples/input/three_loop_k6.toml \
  --output k6.rrcandidate --report-output k6.search.toml --n-cores 1
rustred certify-candidates --input k6.rrcandidate \
  --output k6.rribp --report-output k6.certification.toml
rustred campaign inspect --artifact k6.rribp
```

Generation accepts `--input-format`, `--permutation`, and
`--nonpositive-indices` with their existing meanings. Certification alone
accepts `--max-domain-bound-endpoint-cells`,
`--max-predicate-consistency-work`, and `--max-predicate-atoms` as caller-owned
proof budgets. Increasing a budget never certifies an invalid formula.
Generation supports the generic source solver; certification retains the
current unit-mass vacuum publication admission.

To generate only specific nonzero sectors, pass `--selected-sectors` as a
comma-separated list of binary masks, in the **original input-family coordinate
order**. This is independent of `--permutation` and of the mathematical integral
ordering descriptor. For example, generate only the full sector of the supplied
six-coordinate three-loop family:

```console
rustred family-candidates --input examples/input/three_loop_k6.toml \
  --selected-sectors 111111 --n-cores 2 \
  --output selected.rrcandidate --report-output selected.report.toml
```

Without this option, generation still schedules the complete nonzero root
downset. With it, every listed sector must be nonzero and contained in the root
chosen by `--nonpositive-indices`. Empty, repeated, wrong-arity, zero-sector and
out-of-root masks are rejected. The canonical selection is bound into the
checkpoint identity and appears in the generation report as
`generation_scope = "selected-sectors"` and `selected_sectors`.

**Selected generation is intentionally partial.** Completing these jobs neither
certifies family closure nor supplies rules for omitted sectors. Missing nonzero
sectors remain uncovered; the native family-wide zero analysis is retained.
Changing or omitting an explicit selection when resuming a checkpoint is an
error, even if that selection previously listed every nonzero sector. Inspection
returns the root and the actual saved sector inventory. No extra solver or
topology-specific generation path is used.

`--numerical-depth N` controls the signed-L1 search around fully fixed cases
(default `2`). Zero still searches each unresolved initial seed; it can retain
more finite residuals without changing symbolic search, guards or exact rule
checks. It does not claim the retained integrals are independent masters. The
choice is saved in the bundle's versioned solver policy and reported as
`numerical_depth`. It is independent of loop count, workers and exact backend:

```console
rustred family-candidates --input family.toml --numerical-depth 0 \
  --n-cores 6 --output family.rrcandidate --report-output family.report.toml
```

For long campaigns, opt into resumable, native sector checkpoints:

```console
rustred family-candidates --input family.toml --n-cores 6 \
  --checkpoint-dir TMP/my-campaign --output family.rrcandidate
# After interruption, keep every semantic option identical; workers may change.
rustred family-candidates --input family.toml --n-cores 1 \
  --checkpoint-dir TMP/my-campaign --resume --output family.rrcandidate
```

The dedicated directory's parent must exist. Keep the input, final bundle and
report outside it. `--checkpoint-max-bytes N` sets a positive logical disk-payload
budget (default 1 GiB), independent of the unchanged final candidate/algebra
limits; it is not a memory cap. `--resume` and this budget require
`--checkpoint-dir`. Fresh creation requires an empty directory; `--force`
applies only to final outputs, never checkpoint replacement. One process owns
the directory at a time. No checkpoint is removed automatically.

Completed sectors use the existing native candidate format. Resume checks the
same source, family, root, explicit sector selection, ordering, backend and numerical depth, then solves
only missing sectors. Final assembly imports one shard at a time and preserves
original sector/coefficient order; fully saved work resumes without any search.
Malformed committed files cause an error, not silent replacement. Native data
still requires trusted provenance. A saved sector is not a closure certificate.

The optional `[checkpoint]` report gives reused/new sector counts, charged
disk bytes, validation time and assembly time. `solve_us` includes this
attempt's new solves and sector writes, **not** the historical work reused.
`bundle_encoding_us` includes native assembly. Compare solver benchmarks with
checkpointing disabled, or explicitly include this extra I/O boundary.
Checkpointing avoids retaining all completed expanded solutions, but worker
frames, native state and the final global bundle still consume memory. An
output-limit failure preserves the completed files for a later assembly retry.

`--exact-backend sparse` is the unchanged generation default. The opt-in
`sparse-factorized` choice uses Symbolica's native factorized-denominator field
during exact symbolic materialization and the shared numerical-case lift, then
restores ordinary coefficients before rule extraction. `semi-numerical` selects
Symbolica rational reconstruction and retains ordinary exact replay.
The experimental `sparse-target-factorized` choice instead restricts symbolic
GPLU to the harder/target columns and reconstructs the full row using native
factorized arithmetic; the shared numerical-case lift stays full factorized.
It requires source prefixes independent in the harder/target block and reports
a failure rather than silently falling back. All these strategies are
topology/arity generic.
The selected name appears in the report's `exact_backend` field. These choices
retain the same discovery, guards and candidate format; they do not select an
application cache or certify a bundle.

The optional `--max-negative-index-degree N` still fails closed for `N <= 30`;
larger values are input errors. This numerator-only request leaves positive
propagator dots unbounded, and that successor-closed contract is not implemented.
It is never reinterpreted as total excess or replaced by unrestricted
certification.

The certification-only `--max-total-excess-degree D` option, Rust
`CandidateCertificationRequest::with_max_total_excess_degree(D)` builder and
Python `certify_candidates(..., max_total_excess_degree=D)` keyword request
`sum(max(n_i-1,0) + max(-n_i,0)) <= D` at entry. Successful certification
produces native bounded scope and independently checked descendant degrees,
which may exceed `D`; all replay and publication checks remain required. The
option is omitted by default (`None` in Rust/Python), preserving ordinary
certification. `D` is an unsigned 64-bit integer, including zero, with no
degree-30 ceiling. It is independent of resource limits and mutually exclusive
with the numerator-only request. Large accepted arguments do not promise that
proof work fits the chosen resource limits. For example:

```console
rustred certify-candidates --input saved.candidates.rrbin \
  --max-total-excess-degree 2 --output saved.e2.rrbin
rustred campaign inspect --artifact saved.e2.rrbin
```

This certifies saved formulas without rerunning rule generation. See
[the bounded contract](research/rank_bounded_certification.md).

Native binary bundle schema `rustred.generated-candidates.binary.v1` records
`status = "uncertified-candidates"`, not closure. It cannot be passed to
`campaign inspect` or `campaign reduce` as an artifact. The optional separate
generation report (`rustred.family-candidates-output.toml.v1`) records
`preparation_us`, `solve_us`, `bundle_encoding_us`, and `total_us`.
The certification report (`rustred.candidate-certification-output.toml.v1`)
separately records bundle decoding, preparation, native reconstruction,
certification and artifact encoding. These are observational timings, not part
of the bundle or artifact identity, and exclude a later explicit cold reload.
Successful bounded certification reports additionally include optional
`max_total_excess_degree`, `successor_sector_count` and
`max_successor_total_excess_degree` fields; unrestricted reports omit them.
`certify_candidates_with_progress` observes preparation, replay, lowering,
installation and encoding without regenerating rules or changing proof policy.

Both commands default to stdin/stdout and accept `--force` for atomic file
replacement. `--report-output` must differ from the data output stream/path
and the input file. Both destinations are preflighted before expensive work;
bundle/artifact data is written before its report. Certification failure writes
no artifact or success report, while the saved input bundle remains available.

## Generic family solve diagnostic

`rustred family-solve` accepts the same arbitrary Project TOML as `derive`,
lowers it to the topology-neutral core family, and runs the generic sector
solver. It never dispatches on a family name and does not publish a durable
closing artifact; the output is explicitly marked `status = "diagnostic"`.
Sectors can be supplied as comma-separated bit strings, or are enumerated
automatically for families with at most 16 denominators:

```console
rustred family-solve --input examples/input/four_loop_h.toml \
  --input-format toml --sectors 0000000001 --n-cores 4
```

The command remains useful for bounded sector diagnostics separate from
`family-close`'s complete publication gate. Its currently compiled arity
dispatch supports 1 through 16 denominators; an explicit sector manifest
avoids full enumeration but does not lift that implementation limit.

## Quick start

The smallest input is a single Symbolica expression:

```text
I(
  name(tadpole),
  loops(k),
  externals(),
  dimension(d),
  prop(D1,k^2-m2,1)
)
```

Run it from a file or standard input:

```console
rustred derive --input INPUT.symbolica \
  --input-format symbolica --output one_loop.derive.toml --n-cores 4

rustred derive --input-format symbolica < INPUT.symbolica
```

`--n-cores N` is a positive invocation-wide worker-core budget. The current raw
one-family `derive` command uses one private bounded Rayon pool for independent
ordinary IBP rows, then—after an ordinary/LI barrier—independent LI rows and
relation materialization. `--n-cores 1` stays entirely on the coordinator and
is the deterministic serial reference. For `N > 1`, this current command
constructs exactly `N` worker threads; it has no `--max-memory` policy and does
not derive a smaller effective width. Values greater than one require a
Symbolica license. The RustRed-owned scheduler never reads or mutates Rayon's
global pool, and worker count does not enter the semantic output. Vendored
restricted/unlicensed Symbolica
currently initializes its own one-thread global fallback, while the licensed
multicore path does not use it. Integration tests require
byte-identical output for `N=1`, `N=2`, and `N=4`. The separate implemented
`campaign run-waves --n-cores N` option bounds sibling workers within one
atomic K6 wave; it is not a generic multi-topology execution width.

`parameters(d,m2)` is intentionally absent: RustRed infers family scalars after
excluding declared family identifiers, momenta, and propagator IDs. The
optional `parameters(...)` clause is only an advanced strict allowlist. It can
also disambiguate a numerator-only scalar from tensor syntax—for example, in
`c*vec(k,mu)`, an explicit list can identify `c` as scalar without treating the
Lorentz index `mu` as one. The current `derive` command retains numerators as
unprocessed target metadata and therefore does not guess that distinction.

RustRed retains an explicitly declared allowlist and its source order in the
canonical `I(...)` and in `provenance.input_parameters`. Only scalars actually
discovered in dimension, propagators, power shifts, and external Gram values
enter the operational coefficient field. That active subset is sorted in
`family.parameters`, so declaration order and numerator-only extras cannot
change a family fingerprint or specialize a parametric IBP.

## Input modes

All three modes normalize into the same syntax-authenticated DTO and then use
the same affine lowering and parametric relation generator. There is no
topology or loop-count dispatch in this path.

### Raw Symbolica

Select raw mode with `--input-format symbolica`, or let `auto` recognize an
input whose first expression is `I(...)`, `rustred::I(...)`, or Symbolica's
fully explicit `rustred::{}::I(...)` spelling.

The v1 grammar is:

```text
I(
  name(family_name),                 # optional
  loops(k1,k2,...),                  # required, nonempty
  externals(p1,p2,...),              # required, may be empty
  parameters(d,m2,...),              # optional; inferred when absent
  dimension(d),                      # required
  prop(D1, denominator_expression, target_power),
  prop(D2, denominator_expression, target_power),
  ...,
  power_shift(D1, shift_expression), # optional, at most once per propagator
  gram(p1,p1, scalar_expression),    # one upper-triangular entry per pair
  gram(p1,p2, scalar_expression),
  ...,
  numerator(expression)              # optional concrete target metadata
)
```

Clause order is immaterial. Unknown clauses, repeated singleton clauses,
ambiguous patterns, undeclared identifiers, missing Gram entries, noninteger
target powers, and conflicting labels are errors. `prop` rows must form a
complete affine scalar-product basis: for `L` loops and `E` external momenta,
there are exactly `L(L+1)/2 + L E` propagators.

`target_power` and `numerator(...)` describe a concrete validation/reduction
target. `derive` retains them in its output with disposition
`not_processed_by_derive`; they do not specialize the universal IBP rows.

### Hybrid TOML

Hybrid mode embeds the same compact `I(...)` expression and keeps document
metadata outside it:

```toml
schema = "rustred.project.toml.v1"

integral = """
I(
  name(sunset),
  loops(k1,k2),
  externals(),
  dimension(d),
  prop(D1,k1^2-m2,1),
  prop(D2,k2^2-m2,1),
  prop(D3,(k1+k2)^2-m2,1)
)
"""

[metadata]
description = "two-loop massive vacuum family"
campaign = "massive-vacuum-validation"
tags = ["vacuum", "two-loop"]
```

Metadata is a bounded, sorted table whose values are strings or string arrays.
It is reported as provenance but never enters the family or relation
fingerprint. If supplied, `parameters` is a strict declared allowlist, not
metadata: every scalar discovered in a family-defining field must occur in it.
Its complete user-written order is retained in provenance and canonical input,
while only the discovered subset enters the sorted operational coefficient
context.
Consequently, a declared parameter used solely by `numerator(...)` remains
available for later tensor processing without changing derived IBPs.

### Fully explicit compact TOML

The explicit form is useful for generated configurations and tooling while
still accepting concise Symbolica expressions instead of coefficient
matrices:

```toml
schema = "rustred.project.toml.v1"

[family]
name = "sunset"
loop_momenta = ["k1", "k2"]
external_momenta = []
dimension = "d"

[[family.denominators]]
id = "D1"
expression = "k1^2-m2"

[[family.denominators]]
id = "D2"
expression = "k2^2-m2"

[[family.denominators]]
id = "D3"
expression = "(k1+k2)^2-m2"

[kinematics]
external_gram = []

[target]
powers = [1, 1, 1]
numerator = "1"

[metadata]
description = "explicit form of the same family"
```

`power_shift = "..."` is optional on each denominator. For external
kinematics, `external_gram` is a full symmetric matrix of Symbolica strings.
Its mirrored entries must use identical strings after surrounding whitespace
is removed; the sparse form below avoids duplicating off-diagonal entries.
As an alternative, omit the matrix and provide sparse upper-triangular tables:

```toml
[[kinematics.gram]]
left = "p"
right = "p"
value = "s"
```

The explicit and hybrid fields are mutually exclusive. The TOML reader uses
strict schemas and rejects unknown fields rather than silently ignoring a
misspelling.

### Four-loop vacuum input (external family data)

[`examples/input/four_loop_h.toml`](../examples/input/four_loop_h.toml) is a
fully explicit user-supplied four-loop single-scale vacuum family. It has ten
denominator coordinates because a four-loop vacuum has ten independent scalar
products: the first nine rows are the physical H propagators and `D10` is an
auxiliary ISP with target power zero. This is input data, not a RustRed
topology selector or a built-in family. It can be passed directly to the
generic derivation command:

```console
rustred derive --input examples/input/four_loop_h.toml \
  --input-format toml --output four_loop_h.derive.toml --n-cores 4
```

The same file can be generated by tooling or supplied by an application; no
RustRed source change is needed for another routing, mass polynomial, or
loop count (subject to the authenticated family-basis limits). `derive`
produces the complete parametric ordinary/LI source system. Closing-artifact
campaign orchestration is a separate layer and consumes this normalized family
rather than dispatching on the name `four-loop-unit-mass-vacuum-h`.

## Command contract

```text
rustred derive [OPTIONS]

--input <PATH|->          input path or standard input [default: -]
--output <PATH|->         output path or standard output [default: -]
--input-format <FORMAT>   auto, toml, or symbolica [default: auto]
--relations <SELECTION>   all, ordinary, or li [default: all]
--n-cores <COUNT>         maximum worker cores for parallel stages [default: 1]
--force                   atomically replace an existing output file
```

For values above one, `COUNT` may not exceed the logical cores reported as
available to the process, including operating-system/container restrictions.
This prevents an accidental request from creating an unbounded OS-thread
storm; a 100-core request is admitted on a node exposing at least 100 logical
cores.

Successful standard output contains only the complete TOML document.
Diagnostics go to standard error. File output is staged, synchronized, and
installed atomically in the destination directory; without `--force`, an
existing destination is never replaced.

The current command reports these exit-status categories; pre-alpha interfaces
and schemas may still change during the repository reset:

| Status | Category |
|---:|---|
| 0 | success |
| 2 | command usage |
| 3 | input I/O |
| 4 | input schema, grammar, lowering, or resource limit |
| 5 | parametric derivation |
| 6 | output serialization or size policy |
| 7 | output I/O |
| 8 | parallel-execution setup or Symbolica license policy |
| 70 | internal application invariant |

Both input and output have finite byte limits. The output is fully rendered
and checked before any byte is written to stdout, so an error never leaves a
partial machine-readable document.

Before generation, the shared application service checks a topology-independent
worst-case count of raw relation-term additions, capped at 2,000,000 attempts.
Before rendering,
it charges the packed normalized/source Atoms with a conservative canonical
render factor and censuses all exact family and generated-relation rational
polynomials: sparse numerator/denominator terms, dense exponent payload,
integer magnitudes, shifts, and condition sources share the 256 MiB
retained/render budget. These conservative limits are shared application policy
for both the CLI and the existing Python API; lower-level core-library users can
select their own resource policy. `--relations ordinary` does not construct LI rows;
`--relations li` constructs only the authenticated ordinary source rows needed
internally by LiteRed's LI construction and emits only LI rows.

## Output schema

The output schema is `rustred.derive-output.toml.v1`. It includes:

- RustRed and Symbolica producer versions and the canonical expression-format
  identifier;
- detected input mode, canonical normalized `I(...)`, parameter provenance
  including source and operational orders, and external metadata;
- the family fingerprint, exact parameter order, dimension, momentum order,
  and abstract index names;
- typed scalar-product coordinates and every denominator's canonical source,
  normalized expression, constant, and full affine coefficient row;
- the external Gram matrix and all generic-domain nonzero conditions with
  their deterministic `sources` collections;
- generated/emitted row counts;
- every selected relation with a typed row ID, its ordered integer shift
  vectors, canonical Symbolica coefficients, and exceptional nonzero
  conditions.

The equation convention is recorded literally in each document:

```text
sum(term.coefficient * I(n + term.shift) for term in relation.terms) = 0
```

All authoritative expression strings use Symbolica's fully qualified
`AtomCore::to_canonical_string()` representation. They are independent of
symbol registration order and can be parsed back to the same expression.

## Multi-topology campaign planning

The current `derive` command emits raw generic IBP/LI relations for one family;
it does not solve sectors or publish a closed replacement-rule bundle.
`campaign plan` now provides the deliberately smaller roots-only ingress:

```text
rustred campaign plan --input campaign.toml --output campaign.plan.toml
```

The compact v1 container can contain independently named concrete targets
expressed as ordinary Symbolica `I(...)` strings:

```toml
schema = "rustred.campaign-input.toml.v1"

[[roots]]
id = "tadpole-scalar"
integral = """
I(
  name(tadpole),
  loops(k),
  externals(),
  dimension(d),
  prop(D1,k^2-m2,1)
)
"""

[roots.metadata]
purpose = "scalar validation root"
```

Every `integral` value is passed whole to the existing Symbolica input
compiler; the campaign layer does not split strings or define another
expression grammar. Parameter inference, optional `parameters`, target powers,
numerators, and affine-family lowering therefore have exactly the same input
meaning as under `derive`. The roots-only command retains the numerator but
does not tensor-reduce, scalar-lower, or cancel it against propagators.

Generated configurations may instead use the same existing project schema and
fields under a per-root `project` prefix. This cleanly reuses both its hybrid
`integral` and fully explicit `family` forms:

```toml
[[roots]]
id = "generated-root"

[roots.project]
schema = "rustred.project.toml.v1"

[roots.project.family]
name = "tadpole"
loop_momenta = ["k"]
external_momenta = []
dimension = "d"

[[roots.project.family.denominators]]
id = "D1"
expression = "k^2-m2"

[roots.project.target]
powers = [1]
numerator = "1"
```

The root must choose exactly one of `integral` and `project`. Metadata and
parameters belong beside `integral` in compact mode or inside the nested
project in project mode. Root IDs are unique ingress labels. Families with
identical exact representations and identical `(family, declared-power sector,
ordering)` jobs are interned even when they came from different roots or input
modes. The `declared_power_sector` is derived only from the signs of the
declared target powers. It is deliberately not called a target or normalized sector: numerator
lowering or denominator cancellation can change the eventual concrete support.

A one-root raw Symbolica convenience is also available:

```console
rustred campaign plan --input-format symbolica --root-id tadpole \
  < INPUT.symbolica
```

The output schema is `rustred.campaign-plan-output.toml.v1`. It is sorted by
stable mathematical keys, has the same 256 MiB conservative/final output
limit as `derive`, and explicitly reports `status = "ok"` and
`scope = "roots_only"`.

Thus a successful plan authenticates, lowers, deduplicates, and records only
the supplied declarations and their declared-power jobs. It does not normalize
targets, enumerate subsectors, discover dependencies, derive an IBP, claim
masters/closure, or publish replacement rules. It contains no fictional status
records for those unimplemented operations and no dependency counts.
`campaign plan` deliberately rejects `--n-cores` and `--max-memory`: neither
resource controls a roots-only metadata operation. The K6-specific execution
commands below consume their own strict foundry configuration; they do not
consume or upgrade this roots-only plan into a closure claim.

### Physical campaign preflight

The separate topology-free preflight accepts those physical controls today:

```console
rustred campaign preflight \
  --profile PROFILE.toml \
  --n-cores 100 \
  --max-memory 150GiB \
  --output campaign.preflight.toml
```

The profile schema is `rustred.campaign-execution-resource-profile.v1`.
There are deliberately no default byte estimates: it must explicitly provide
an estimator revision, an enclosing memory limit, all fixed components, and
the retained/transient envelope of a one-core minimum runnable task. Byte
strings accept only an unsigned integer followed by the case-sensitive binary
unit `B`, `KiB`, `MiB`, `GiB`, or `TiB`. Unknown TOML fields and arithmetic
overflow are rejected.

Output uses schema
`rustred.campaign-execution-preflight-output.toml.v1`. It reports either a
`ready` width or `paused_for_memory_capacity` with a typed shortfall. Both are
valid preflight outcomes and exit with status 0; invalid arguments exit 2 and
an invalid profile exits 4. Every unsigned output integer is a lossless decimal
string, identified by `unsigned_integer_encoding = "unsigned-decimal-string"`.

This command invokes only the pure width planner. It does not parse a topology,
initialize Symbolica or require a license, consume an accepted plan, construct
a worker pool, hydrate a reducer, or schedule campaign work. The inline test
profiles contain illustrative values, not named-host measurements.

### Bounded K6 foundry execution

Two implemented commands exercise the current K6 foundry without accepting
recurrence algebra from the caller:

```console
rustred campaign run \
  --config CONFIG.toml \
  --output run.report.toml \
  --measurements-output run.measurements.toml

rustred campaign run-waves \
  --config examples/k6_autonomous_campaign.toml \
  --output waves.report.toml \
  --measurements-output waves.measurements.toml \
  --artifact-output waves.rribp \
  --n-cores 4
```

Both commands consume schema `rustred.foundry-campaign-config.toml.v2`.
`mode = "autonomous"` admits no caller-authored hint object: RustRed selects
the proposal ordering, probes, coordinate priority, and itinerary. `mode =
"external-hints-only"` requires a typed `[hints]` object containing only
bounded search metadata. Neither form can encode an imported identity,
recurrence right-hand side, coefficient, source row, support, reduction, or
artifact payload. `campaign run` requires the single-sector fixed-point
itinerary and remains diagnostic-only. `campaign run-waves` requires the
full-rank atomic-wave itinerary and publishes same-rank siblings only as a
complete wave.

The deterministic semantic schemas are
`rustred.foundry-campaign-report.toml.v2` and
`rustred.foundry-wave-campaign-report.toml.v2`. Optional timing sidecars use
`rustred.foundry-campaign-measurements.toml.v1` and
`rustred.foundry-wave-campaign-measurements.toml.v1`; timings never enter the
semantic report. The stderr dashboard is terminal-only by default,
`--no-progress` disables it, and `--color auto|always|never` controls only that
presentation.

A completed process is not necessarily a closed campaign. An incomplete wave
report has `publication = "diagnostic_only"`, `outcome = "incomplete"`,
`artifact_installed = false`, and `durable_artifact_published = false`. It owns
no artifact bytes and does not touch `--artifact-output`; the report instead
contains the blocking wave and detached exact residual diagnostics for every
blocking sibling. Only a fully published wave chain is installed as a K6
artifact, encoded into native bytes, decoded through the cold validation
boundary, replayed, and semantically compared with its re-encoding before artifact bytes become
available. Report, measurement, and artifact destinations must be distinct;
lexical aliases and aliases through existing symlinked parents are rejected
before any write, including with `--force`.

The supplied external-hint and autonomous example configurations are bounded
release inputs, not evidence of K6 closure. Run both from a release build after
each coherent foundry slice and retain their exact residual geometry, resource
stop, and execution time. K6 remains open until both lanes independently pass
the documented closure, replay, reload, and representative-reduction gates.

### Durable closing artifacts

Three fine-grained campaign operations expose the completed `K = 1` and
`K = 3` closing artifacts without introducing topology-name dispatch:

```console
rustred campaign generate \
  --family unit-mass-vacuum-k1 \
  --output one_loop.rr

rustred campaign inspect \
  --artifact one_loop.rr \
  --output one_loop.inspect.toml

rustred campaign reduce \
  --artifact one_loop.rr \
  --powers 3 \
  --output one_loop.I3.toml

rustred campaign generate \
  --family unit-mass-vacuum-k3 \
  --output two_loop_sunset.rr

rustred campaign reduce \
  --artifact two_loop_sunset.rr \
  --powers 2,2,1 \
  --output two_loop_sunset.I221.toml
```

`campaign generate` writes the native binary artifact itself, not a
TOML proxy. The semantic family selectors are `unit-mass-vacuum-k1` and
`unit-mass-vacuum-k3`. There is no preset K6 selector: use the generic
`family-close` command with `examples/input/three_loop_k6.toml` to generate
the closed K6 artifact from its ordinary IBPs. The CLI and Python K6 examples
include fresh-process inspection and canary application.
`campaign inspect` and `campaign reduce` require artifact bytes from a path or
from `--artifact -`; neither substitutes a hidden preset for those bytes. The
`K = 3` cold validation boundary regenerates its registered derivation once
and compares complete program structure and all exact coefficients, including
ordered variable maps, after native state remapping. Ambient Symbolica
registrations can change dump bytes without changing these semantics. Native
Atom/State payloads must come from trusted generators; mathematical validation
does not make the native binary reader a hardened hostile-input parser. No
foundry work or authentication repeats in the reducer hot path. Generation
output uses the existing atomic file installer, so `--force` is required to
replace an existing file. Invalid or truncated bytes are rejected before any
requested TOML output file is created.

The equivalent stream operation is exact binary piping:

```console
rustred campaign generate --family unit-mass-vacuum-k1 \
  | rustred campaign inspect --artifact -
```

Inspection emits schema
`rustred.closing-artifact-inspect-output.toml.v4` after one bounded decode,
authentication, and exact replay. Reduction emits schema
`rustred.closing-artifact-reduce-output.toml.v3`, exact Symbolica-canonical
unit-mass coefficients keyed by master power vectors, and a separate decimal
string `common_mass_squared_power`. For `--powers 3`, the only master is `[1]`,
the coefficient is
`(-6*rustred::{}::d+8+rustred::{}::d^2)*1/8`, and the common-mass-squared
power is `-2`.

For a cold-verified bounded owner, inspection additionally reports
`artifact.total_excess_scope` with `max_entry_total_excess_degree`,
`successor_sector_count` and `max_successor_total_excess_degree`. This is a
summary, not the complete persisted successor map. Existing inspection and
reduction commands consume bounded bytes through their ordinary loader; it
reproves the scope before exposing the owner.

`--max-rule-applications N` is a nonnegative per-call ceiling, defaulting to
and capped at 1,000,000. Durable input is bounded at 256 MiB before decode and
then by the core codec's structural, string, coefficient, arity, and exact-
algebra limits. Successful decoding produces one sealed owner; recursive hot-
path application does not repeat cold authentication.

`family-close`, `campaign inspect` and `campaign reduce` accept three matching
resource controls:

- `--max-domain-bound-endpoint-cells N`: conservative per-rule endpoint-buffer
  allowance, default 8,192.
- `--max-predicate-consistency-work N`: aggregate native consistency work per
  exact predicate-cover traversal, default 4,194,304. It is not reset on each
  Boolean branch or cache miss.
- `--max-predicate-atoms N`: distinct affine atoms per cover, default 32 and
  supported maximum 256. Atom IDs and assignments are dynamically sized;
  the supported ceiling bounds recursive traversal depth. The separate native
  affine equation, Boolean-node, clause and work ceilings remain in force.

Zero is a restrictive allowance, not an unlimited setting. Larger allowances
permit more verification work or storage; they do not remove a guard, skip a
proof or authorize a new master. Choose sufficient limits explicitly for both
generation and subsequent untrusted loading. They are caller policy, not
trusted artifact contents, and successful choices do not change durable bytes.
Values above 256 are rejected for the atom policy before generation or decoding;
zero permits coordinate-only covers, not an unlimited predicate allowance.
The Rust policies expose `max_predicate_atoms`; Python's `family_close`,
`inspect_closing_artifact` and `reduce_with_closing_artifact` accept the same
optional keyword (default `None`, selecting the core default). All three
reports include it as a decimal-string resource field; family generation uses
`rustred.family-close-output.toml.v4`. Durable artifact schemas are unchanged.
The existing input/output byte ceiling and other structural limits remain.
Reports record chosen resource counts as decimal strings so every supported
`usize` value is representable in TOML.

The core library contains a host-independent pre-pool effective-width planner,
checked resource values, bounded ordered execution, and the K6-specific
single-sector and atomic-wave foundry drivers. Roots-only family/sector/job
interning is application-owned. The width plan enforces
`M_operational < M_enclosing`, charges the coordinator and every possible
warmed worker plus one minimum runnable task, and returns a typed no-fit pause
without constructing a pool. The roots-only CLI remains separate; the resource
preflight exposes only the pure decision from an explicit profile. Named-host
calibration, task-specific estimator adapters, generic multi-family campaign
execution, and checkpointing remain unimplemented. The
fine-grained artifact commands are separate from roots-only planning and
physical preflight. The generic K6 artifact and through-three-loop Vakint
integration are available. Four-loop public numerical references and pinch
checks pass; see the [numerical acceptance checkpoint](checkpoints/2026-09-19.md#completed-public-numerical-acceptance).
Optional bounded four-loop artifact certification remains unfinished; see the
[bounded certification audit](research/rank30_certification_audit_2026-09-17.md).

`--n-cores` is always a ceiling. The planner derives an effective execution
width `E` with `1 <= E <= --n-cores`. `E=1` denotes inline coordinator
execution without a worker pool; `E>1` denotes `E` worker threads, while the
separate coordinator remains another possible Symbolica workspace owner. The
fixed baseline therefore charges the coordinator plus every possible worker
and any explicitly admitted inner thread. If the inline baseline plus one
minimum runnable task does not fit, preflight returns a typed memory-capacity
pause.

Operators should keep `--max-memory` below physical RAM to preserve headroom
for the OS and opaque Symbolica scratch that its public API cannot census. The
reported width, limits, fixed breakdown, and estimator revision are physical
metadata excluded from mathematical identities. The exact closure boundary,
remaining checkpoint work, and parallel-memory contracts are documented in
the [foundry design](foundry.md); the present K6 commands implement only the
bounded execution and conditional publication surfaces described above.
