# From the SpIRed vacuum source port to a shipped Vakint K6 artifact

## Delivery status (2026-09-16)

K1/K3/K6 artifacts and exact offline terminal projections are shipped on
GammaLoop's `vakint_rustred` branch. The complete recorded through-three-loop
selection passes **83/83**, with no failures or ignored tests, including all
five three-loop classes. Native FeynKit/RustRed lanes use invalid FORM paths;
separate AlphaLoop/MATAD oracle lanes use FORM. Revision `433e42d3` corrects
MATAD's contracted-numerator orientation; pushed revision `a3d26dab` repeats
the complete gate on Symbolica 3 with published RustRed `09cef8e3` and its
regenerated K6 asset. See [the dependency migration report](vakint_symbolica3_migration.md).

The active delivery target is four loops. None of its four physical parent
families has a closed artifact yet. The previous full FG run completes sector
discovery but times out during exact source-certificate construction. Optional
preconditioner provenance now lets the selected sector 214 check finish in
106.6 seconds, with 154/161 candidates passing and seven affine candidates
failing geometry. Coverage stops at its first counterexample valuation;
the reported bounded region is not proof of a globally finite complement.
The subsequent full physical FG CLI attempt searches all 124 sectors and
passes 32 audits, then rejects sector 214 on those same obligations after
138.07 seconds wall. No artifact is written; see
[the certificate profile](research/original_source_certificate_performance.md).
The dated K6 development sections below are historical, not current open gates.

### Four-loop adapter and acceptance boundary

The frozen [matcher census](four_loop_vakint_census.md) has **19 registered
classes**: H, X, BMW, and FG with 15 contractions. All 123 surviving physical
slots transport exactly under the retained simultaneous witnesses and match
the four external parent inputs. This census is distinct from the fifteen
numerical reference entrypoints and does not establish IBP closure.

An independent source audit confirms that the existing topology matcher already
retains simultaneous parent routing for the four-loop parents and contractions.
The adapter must consume that witness and structural parent descriptors rather
than rematching graphs or dispatching on topology names. H/X input families
have nine physical coordinates plus one auxiliary; BMW/FG have eight plus two.
Every family has ten complete scalar-product coordinates and sixteen ordinary
IBPs. Absent physical lines and auxiliary starting powers are zero-filled.
RustRed's generic scalar-numerator lowering, memoized rule applier and mass
restoration already own the algebra; Vakint must not duplicate them.

Actual closing artifacts and exact offline terminal catalogs must be shipped
before activating this lane. A typed master-basis descriptor should select
the existing pure FMFT PR finalizer instead of the current MATAD finalizer.
Finite nonminimal terminal bases use numerical-parity policy, not a demand
for an identical MATAD basis. Existing defaults and FORM-backed modes remain
unchanged.

The frozen Symbolica 3 baseline passes all **15 deterministic four-loop FMFT
reference entrypoints**: fourteen analytic cases plus the decorated four-loop
clover whose test name misleadingly contains `1l`. All **eight native PR
finalizer unit tests** also pass with invalid FORM paths. These 23 passes do
**not** establish four-loop RustRed reduction: the references still use FMFT,
and finalizer units begin with already-reduced masters. The eventual native
comparative harness must cover all fifteen entrypoints, retaining their
numerators, nonunit masses, decorated indices, symbols and tolerances.

Five optional four-loop PySecDec comparisons remain supplemental. One PR9d
pinch requests epsilon^1, beyond the current FMFT table's finite term, and
needs additional master data rather than a silently shortened comparison.
Existing PR9d/PR11d finite constants contain 28/26 decimal digits respectively;
increasing arithmetic precision does not create additional source accuracy.
The native finalizer currently rejects requested precision above those stored
values whereas legacy FMFT permits it. This policy difference is identified,
not silently removed or covered by a claimed 20,000-digit master catalog.
The independent audit, exact test inventory and frozen run logs are retained at
`/tmp/vakint-four-loop-frozen-gate.FKioIB/`.

## Historical acceptance audit (2026-09-15)

K1/K3/K6 assets and exact offline terminal projections are now shipped on
GammaLoop's `vakint_rustred` branch. Revision `98550cc0` records 76 passing
invocations, but a raw-log audit found that this does **not** establish complete
through-three-loop acceptance: the three-loop selection contains 24 tests
while its result table has 17 entries. One omitted test has a failed raw log
for an AlphaLoop-versus-MATAD comparison. Independent reruns of the missing
seven now give five passes and two failures: the joined selection is 83 tests,
81 passed and two failed. Mapped peers for the legacy 40-entry / 46-input
inventory and both basketball finite parts pass. Two supplemental all-class
pipelines fail at `I3L_pinch_1_6` on AlphaLoop versus MATAD before the RustRed
comparison; separate pairwise diagnostics are underway. Native tensor and scalar stages use FeynKit and RustRed
with an invalid FORM path; separate oracle lanes use FORM only for validation.

The sections below retain dated implementation evidence; their pending K6
artifact and acceptance gates were subsequently resolved as summarized above.
No four-loop artifact or four-loop native acceptance pass is claimed. See
[the current goal](../GOAL.md) and
[four-loop closure probes](four_loop_ordering_probe.md).

## Goal and current boundary

Turn RustRed's independently generated, complete `vac3` reference workload
into a cold-loadable, reusable K6 closing artifact, then ship it with Vakint's
opt-in RustRed scalar backend. Vakint must use its existing FeynKit tensor
prepass, topology match and routing witness, and pure-Rust master evaluation.
Ordinary evaluation must neither generate IBPs nor invoke FORM.

This is a parallel integration lane; it does not replace the ongoing generic
source-port work. The canonical unit-mass source-port output now installs as a
`ClosedArtifact` and passes **durable encode/decode and fresh-process release
generation/loading/application tests**. Vakint shipping and acceptance remain.
Matching a C++ workload, certifying a reduction program and
shipping a reusable asset are separate milestones.

The implementation should extend the existing immutable `ClosedArtifact` and
memoized `Reducer` ownership, not introduce a second legacy artifact wrapper.
RustRed schema compatibility is not required. Preserve Vakint's existing
defaults, public conventions, and FORM-backed methods.

The user has approved the current Symbolica API migration in Spenso and a
private helper retaining Vakint's already-computed parent momentum routing.
Implement these against the current pinned dependencies; the anticipated
Symbolica 3.0 stack upgrade is separate. Preserve the public `force_an_lmb`
signature and reuse its actual witness, without another graph match or solve.

The implementation boundary is explicit: RustRed owns artifact validation,
rule applicability, recursive/memoized IBP application and exact integral-key
results. Vakint steers those existing crate capabilities using its topology
match/routing and shipped assets, then invokes its existing master evaluation.
No artifact applier or recurrence engine belongs in the Vakint adapter.

The approved migration now passes combined Spenso/Vakint library and test-
target checking. Frozen binaries execute the three new Spenso tests, five
native K6 candidate tests, six existing RustRed adapter tests (including strict
generated-asset byte parity) and four default/backend tests successfully. The
Vakint native groups use an invalid FORM path. K1/K3 assets were regenerated
through the existing generator in current V5 format and independently loaded
and applied; their bytes were not patched manually. This does not install the
new source-port K6 artifact or validate complete three-loop scalar reduction.

Isolated execution of the six added routing tests failed at test setup: they bypass normal
Vakint initialization and register a symbol before its required attributes.
The subsequent failures share a poisoned initializer, rather than proving six
routing defects. A broader native run passed 22 tests, failed one and ignored
one; its component-template failure identified the need for Symbolica's existing
`allow_new_wildcards_on_rhs(true)` flag when constructing that template. Final
component binding remains strict. The user has explicitly approved both setup
fixes, with every assertion unchanged, and waived routine approval requests
except for highly ambiguous or dangerous changes. Corrected execution is still
a gate, not a pass inferred from this diagnosis. The
independent offline test now passes exact symbolic comparison of all 38 candidate
keys with MATAD at the configured Laurent order, including common-mass restoration.
This is not an all-dimension raw-coefficient identity test. Only the explicit
oracle path uses the verified FORM 5.0.1 executable; the native finalizer keeps
an invalid FORM path. This validates the proposed terminal data, not the missing
production K6 asset or complete three-loop comparative pipeline.

### Current milestone: durable codec correctness (2026-09-15)

The original-domain producer now round-trips through the existing V5 codec:
**8,911,462 bytes**, 623 generated rules replayed from nine ordinary IBPs,
5,639 sign-refined cells, 38 finite terminal keys and 26 proved-zero sectors. Source identities are
interned and referenced by their cells. Loading reconstructs the canonical
family and its ordinary IBPs, replays each full weighted identity on its true
domain, checks guards and strict descent, and revalidates the whole unbounded
sector cover. It does not rerun source-port discovery or create another reducer.

The complete K6 correctness test verifies exact re-encoding, all decoded master
identities, a mixed-master nonunit-mass reduction and cache reuse. Focused tests
reject corrupted identities, source references, RHS values, offsets, omitted
poles, and incomplete domains. A coordinated gate passes 302 focused tests,
the separately enabled full K6 durable test and the 56/9 source/audit example
tests. Evidence: `target/spired-codec-indices-corrected.FrerFY/`.
These debug executions establish correctness, not performance.

The standalone release producer now writes byte-identical artifacts at one
and six workers. Two fresh CLI inspection processes independently load them;
five further CLI processes apply master, dotted, pinched and negative-power
canaries, including symbolic common-mass restoration. The inspected terminal
keys match all 38 catalog candidates; their distinct sector masks and the 26
zero masks partition all 64 sectors. No ordinary evaluation reruns discovery.
Evidence: `target/spired-k6-producer.007TpB/run/`.

Observed whole-process generation took 3.20 s at one worker and 1.86 s at six,
with approximately 237 MiB peak RSS in each process. These are single
shared-host release observations, not a paired performance comparison: notably,
the serial process incurred far more major page faults. The producer's measured
phases separate rule generation (0.423/0.062 s), exact installation
(2.429/1.527 s) and encoding (0.112/0.072 s). Those phase intervals are not the
whole logical-cold time. Actual Vakint shipping and its complete comparative
three-loop suite remain the next delegated gates.

The following dated sections retain earlier checkpoint evidence; their pending
gates describe those checkpoints rather than overriding the current status.

### Existing artifact and reducer work in memory (2026-09-15)

All three vacuum families now pass the combined original-domain producer into
the existing `ClosedArtifact` and memoizing `Reducer`. Canonical K6 retains
**623 independently generated rules, 5,639 sign-refined cells, 38 finite
terminal corners, and 26 proved-zero sectors**. Every cell derives from full
weighted original-source replay on its true domain. The installer admits only
the registered producer, verifies strict descent and all inherited guards,
and proves an empty unbounded complement for the whole sector census.

Sign refinement handles physical RHS sector changes without inventing a new
ordering. A separate grounding check found 5,303 surviving term/sign cells:
3,431 stay in-sector and 1,872 pinch to a proper lower sector. All pass the
existing descent witness; none activates or swaps an active line. Other
products vanish by exact coefficient identities or native zero-sector proofs.

The focused test batch passes **269 tests**, including K1 exact reducer parity,
nonunit mass restoration and observed cache hits, K3 exact parity after mapping
its four actual terminal keys into the old canonical basis, six full-residual
negative tests and four checked-payload mutation tests. The separately run
complete K6 test installs the artifact and checks every master identity plus
a dotted reduction in every nonzero sector, adding a negative numerator power
where an inactive slot exists. Those canaries test
application; they do not establish closure in place of the unbounded proof.
Independent implementation/mathematical and raw execution audits pass.
Evidence: `target/spired-original-domain-full.JEvHje/`; debug timings are not
performance measurements.

At this checkpoint the next boundary was **durable serialization and
fresh-process cold reload**. The encoder deliberately rejected this evidence kind until its real
payload and cold proof reconstruction are implemented. There is no alternate
artifact wrapper, fabricated anchor or elimination history, or repeated
authentication in the reducer's hot path. Vakint integration proceeds in
parallel, but no new three-loop acceptance result or shipped K6 asset is claimed
by this in-memory milestone.

### Canonical unit-mass checked ownership (2026-09-15)

The cold bridge now retains a private `CheckedProgram` through the same checks
used by its public diagnostic report. Its consuming gate owns the actual
family and original-source corpus, wide `i64` target/source displacements,
exact RHS and normalized source weights, parameter applicability, unbounded
application boxes, finite terminal keys, native zero proofs, and one persisted
ordering shared by all sectors. It rejects mutated rules, missing finite or
infinite coverage, duplicate or missing sectors, foreign family binding and
incompatible per-sector priorities. Seven focused ownership tests pass; the
combined solver/source-port suite passes 225 tests, and the source example
suite passes 53 tests.

The explicit release regression generates from the existing canonical
unit-mass K6 family, without importing the reference equations or transporting
their coefficients. It retains **623 exact rules across all 38 nonzero
sectors, with 38 finite terminals and 26 independently proved-zero sectors**.
Every rule and the entire family pass original-source replay, guard admission,
strict descent and the unbounded cover gate. The 623 count is measured for this
canonical ordering; it must not be replaced by the differently ordered,
symbolic-mass reference workload's 617.

The direct release test took 1.62 s wall, 1.55 s user plus 0.03 s system CPU,
with 12,300 KiB peak RSS. It ran on CPU 2 with pools capped at one while an
example build ran separately on CPUs 16-23. This single shared-host timing is
diagnostic, not a paired performance comparison. It includes construction,
zero census, all-sector generation and exact checked ownership, but no
serialization or decoding. Evidence:
`target/spired-program-owner.eAmBDX/{canonical-k6.stdout,canonical-k6.stderr,canonical-k6.time}`.

At this earlier checkpoint it was **not yet a `ClosedArtifact`**, a shipped
asset or a Vakint acceptance pass. The next slice needed to lower the same
retained combined-original-identity
evidence into the existing rule-cell/artifact owner and cold codec, without
inventing old anchor/counter witnesses. A subsequent fixture-only correctness
test now checks that **each actual retained typed terminal vector is exactly
its nonzero sector's 0/1 corner**, and prints all 38 keys. This supplies the
actual-key binding needed by the corner-orbit feasibility study below, not
merely a matching total count. Its evidence is
`target/spired-terminal-key-gate.aIh7F1/canonical-keys.txt`; all-target checking,
225 core tests and 53 example tests also pass. This debug execution is
correctness evidence only. The additional assertion and mechanical extraction
of discovery tests do not change the frozen optimized runtime binaries or
their measured algorithm. The final installed artifact/catalog must still
retain and verify this same exact key set.

The parallel Vakint lane now prepares those 38 exact terminal records in a
test-only `rustred_evaluation::terminal::k6` module. The verified corner orbits
require only five existing expressions: the tadpole cube, tadpole times
sunset, `miBN`, the complete five-line MATAD expression, and `miD6`. The
five-line record retains its outer minus sign. No new numerical master table
is presently needed. Independent data reviews match all 38 keys to the actual
checked-program output; four native tests cover key/orbit identity, oracle
anchors, product signs and internal normalization. **Those tests remain
unrun** while GammaLoop's Spenso wrapper calls the removed public Symbolica
linear-solver API. This candidate data is not yet a `TerminalCatalog`, an
embedded K6 asset, or a new acceptance pass; its module is deliberately absent
from production builds until the real artifact can bind it.

The existing parametric-rule model now distinguishes anchored elimination
replay from `CombinedOriginalDomain` evidence. Anchor, elimination-count and
pivot-history accessors are optional; a combined-domain record cannot borrow
the other producer's history. This is a preparatory representation change:
the combined producer and its installer are not enabled yet. Existing cell
constructors, anchor-directed guard splitting, installation and encoders
explicitly reject that unsupported evidence kind. The current durable grammar
is unchanged, rather than inventing an anchor to encode new rules.

The coordinated gate compiled all 1,704 library tests and passed all-target
checking plus 110 focused tests, including all 11 new getter/rejection tests,
the existing K1/K3 durable/reducer checks and source-port checks. The separate
canonical K6 correctness test again retained 623 rules and the same 38 exact
terminal keys. Evidence is in `target/spired-evidence-migration.STLdzz/`.
These debug checks add no new timing claim or Vakint acceptance result. The
next implementation step is the actual combined original-identity constructor
and supplied-domain rule-cell lowering, followed by the durable codec.

### First implementation checkpoint

The existing `OrderingPolicy` now exposes `SpiredUncutV1` and a persisted
coordinate-priority variant. Concrete comparisons and symbolic shift witnesses
share the same comparison semantics; the original policies and defaults remain
unchanged. Ten new tests include exhaustive small comparisons with the source
port, the actual `001011` counterexample below, extreme runtime indices, and
pinch/activation boundaries. All 76 sector tests and nine existing artifact
persistence tests pass. Independent mathematical/implementation review passes.
These witnesses describe their stated representable domains; the subsequent
whole-ray certificate must retain genuinely unbounded integer endpoints.

The parallel Vakint lane has added five-class tensor/oracle fixtures and an
explicitly pending RustRed peer in its existing comparative harness. An offline
candidate utility prepares exact MATAD-basis records for the 38 proposed finite
corners, avoiding numerical truncation if those projections succeed. Its input
keys, routing and normalization have been independently audited. Neither the
new Vakint tests nor the candidate evaluations have run: compilation is blocked
by an obsolete Spenso forwarding call following the required Symbolica update.
The user has been asked about migrating that unused public wrapper to the new
native API; Vakint's public API would remain unchanged.

The previously linked September 2 MATAD oracle executable does still run:
its nine existing exact raw-master records pass with the installed FORM5.
This is an offline oracle smoke check, not a build of current GammaLoop or a
RustRed acceptance pass. An isolated consumer for the 38 candidate keys could
not link against that preserved library set because its matching transitive
RustRed library had subsequently been overwritten. No cache/fingerprint or
Spenso workaround was applied. Evidence:
`target/vakint-existing-oracle-smoke.IbXhcU/` and
`target/vakint-cached-terminal-oracle.NWFhoN/`.

Its acceptance inventory now maps all 40 legacy test entries (46 input
executions), including aliases and previously missing normalization, epsilon
depth, decorated-index and external-vector variants. New peers reuse the same
comparative harness; two additional basketball cases include the finite part.
Enabled is not synonymous with passed: the new one-loop variant is unrun and
the new three-loop peers remain explicitly pending. The inventory lives in
GammaLoop at `crates/vakint/tests/RUSTRED_ACCEPTANCE.md`; no reference-repository
contents are copied into RustRed's Git history.

No new certified K6 artifact, installed K6 scalar backend, or three-loop
RustRed acceptance pass is claimed by this checkpoint. The cold
replay/descent/cover pass below now succeeds; durable certificate ownership
and installation are the next implementation gate.

### Retained original-source certificates (2026-09-15)

The integration lane now retains each original `RowId`, checked `i64`
target-relative translation and exact coefficient together, before removing
zero coefficients. The first retained form explicitly identifies its
denominator-cleared adapter normalization. Its proof concerns the complete
weighted identity and combined residual; it does not pretend that cancelling
terms can be deleted independently from every source. This is private cold
data, not a second artifact type or a constructor for `ClosedArtifact`.
Three new retention tests and eight normalization tests pass, within the
211-test solver/source-replay batch.

The normalization bridge now binds these records to freshly generated
`ParametricRelation` rows, verifying a native polynomial multiplier against
every source coefficient and checking both the variable map and index map.
Translations use `i64` offsets and happen before fixed-coordinate
specialization; normalized weights and pre-cancellation source conditions stay
together. Added denominator obligations go through the existing exact guard
path. Symbolica owns ratios, multiplication and translation; the adapter's
denominator-clearing algorithm is not duplicated.

The fresh release census still passes all 617 K6 identities with zero issues,
extra guard branches or uncovered regions at one and six requested workers.
K1 and K3 likewise pass, and all semantic reports agree across worker counts.
K6 generation plus audit takes 1.370 s / 0.363 s in-process and 1.39 s / 0.39 s
process wall in these single observations. These shared-host diagnostics do
not prove a performance improvement and still exclude artifact encoding and
cold decode. Evidence: `target/spired-artifact-integration.bo3iL6/RESULTS.md`.

Durable ownership, serialization, cold loading and installation still need to
follow. Vakint's five-class routing and master-evaluation lane runs separately;
no ignored three-loop test becomes a pass merely because the source-rule
census is complete. Its contraction machinery can change loop coordinates:
the surviving propagator IDs must join to parent artifact slots, and the
existing simultaneous routing witness must also transport the numerator.
Assigning powers to six slots alone does not prove that match.

### Complete cold rule-set audit (2026-09-15)

`SourcePortAudit` and the autonomous `spired-artifact-audit` Rust example now
perform independent ordinary-source replay, fresh RHS/derivation guard
extraction, zero-sector authentication, whole-orthant coordinate coverage, and
piecewise source-port descent. The diagnostic deliberately cannot mint a
`ClosedArtifact` or supply an installation token. Its original sixteen tests pass,
including corrupted RHS/provenance, omitted exclusions, finite versus infinite
gaps, activation-boundary checks, and inconsistent physical/coefficient seed
translations (including a jointly forged seed and RHS). Workspace checking
also passes.

The complete autonomous release census now passes for all three vacuum
families, at both one and six requested workers:

| Family | Nonzero / proved-zero sectors | Original sources | Rules replayed and descending | Finite terminals | Additional guards / uncovered regions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| K1 | 1 / 1 | 1 | 1 / 1 | 1 | 0 / 0 |
| K3, all pinches | 4 / 4 | 4 | 18 / 18 | 4 | 0 / 0 |
| K6 | 38 / 26 | 9 | **617 / 617** | 38 | **0 / 0** |

Every report has zero issues, zero stored-guard and checked-rule gaps, and zero
uncovered unbounded boxes. Semantic reports agree across worker counts. This
verifies the complete rule-set replay/descent/cover; the diagnostic still
does not retain a durable certificate or construct a `ClosedArtifact`.
Canonical unit-mass installation, serialization/cold loading, the five-class
Vakint routing gate and the current acceptance suite remain separate work.

The final correction verifies full **weighted original-source identities**.
Some residual contributions have coefficient `n0*(n0+1)` and shift `n0+2`:
the integral lies in a proved-zero sector for `n0<=-2`, while the coefficient
vanishes on both activation points `n0=-1,0`. Those products become zero only
after combining rows; independent raw-term deletion cannot prove them. The
native exact reducer may propose weights in a projected frame, but both
proposal paths must pass full unprojected multiplication and exact sign-cell
verification. Finite boundary sets are exhausted under a hard budget;
unbounded coordinates remain symbolic. Corrupted weights/sources, either
missing endpoint root, a zero denominator, an infinite nonzero tail and budget
exhaustion all have rejecting tests. No generated reduction rule was changed.

K6 generation plus this independent audit took **2.151 s in-process / 2.18 s
process wall** at one worker, and **0.495 s / 0.53 s** at six workers. Aggregate
CPU times were 2.13 s and 2.27 s; peak RSS was 9,232 and 9,244 KiB. These are
single release observations, not a paired SpIRed benchmark or publication /
cold-artifact-load timing. Evidence: `target/spired-combined-replay.cmaXc8/`.
The initial failed census below is retained as diagnostic history.

The first autonomous full release census completed at both one and six workers:

| Family | Ordinary sources | Rules | Replayed and descending | Finite terminals | Bridge replay failures |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| K1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| K3, including all pinches | 4 | 18 | 15 | 4 | 3 |
| K6, all 38 nonzero sectors | 9 | 617 | 387 | 38 | 230 |

Both worker counts produced identical semantic reports. All stored-guard
covers had zero uncovered boxes. The initial checked K6 cover retained 283
boxes (282 unbounded) across 28 sectors because the ordinary-source bridge
could not certify 230 rules. These were **certificate-bridge gaps**, not newly
established failures of those IBPs. All had the same original-frame membership
diagnostic; the smaller K3 pinch failures exposed the mechanism below. The
subsequent coefficient-aware and weighted-product corrections resolve all of
them, as recorded in the current complete census above.

A standalone native-Rust inspection establishes the K3 mechanism. After the
canonical target translation, an original ordinary source contains
`-(n0+1) I(n0+2,n1-1,0)` on `n0<=-1, n1>=2`. The integral is in a proved-zero
sector when `n0<=-2`; at the activation wall `n0=-1` its coefficient is zero.
The product therefore vanishes on the whole admitted domain, although the
integral label alone does not. Native Symbolica also verifies the complete
unprojected preconditioned row equals `2*ordinary0 + ordinary1 - 2*ordinary2 -
ordinary3`, with no remainder. This particular miss is therefore a projection
limitation, not missing source support or an invalid identity. The first bridge used only label-wise zero
projection. The scoped correction must prove product vanishing on every exact
sign cell using native coefficient substitution, with a coefficient-1 negative
control. It does not modify the IBPs or relax their guards. Inspection evidence:
`target/source-port-pinch-inspector.R8Y9qx/canonical-output.txt`.

On this diagnostic run, K6 generation plus the audit took 1.973 s logically
in-process / 2.01 s process wall time with one worker, and 0.494 s / 0.53 s
with six workers. Aggregate CPU times were 1.96 s and 2.10 s; peak RSS was
9,244 and 15,408 KiB. These are single diagnostic observations, not paired
SpIRed performance claims or timings for a completed artifact. Release
compilation preceded the runs. Evidence:
`target/spired-cold-artifact.ckZDsX/` (frozen binary hash and all six runs).

An independent ordinary-source certificate can introduce avoidable poles.
The report therefore keeps stored-guard and certificate-checked coverage
separate, records per-rule failures, and continues the full census. A pole in
one chosen certificate is not proof that its target rule is invalid: obtaining
a regular certificate may remove that obligation. The native polynomial
preconditioner uses exact polynomial quotients and does not divide out pivot
content, so it does not by itself introduce rational poles.

## Evidence already available

The release outputs under
`target/spired-rational-regression.KO3jlH/3-w1` and `3-w6` contain:

- all 38 requested nonzero sectors, with 617 conditional rules;
- 38 fully fixed residual keys, each exactly the 0/1 corner of a nonzero
  sector: 16 three-line, 15 four-line, six five-line and one six-line corner;
- exact native coefficient, target-pattern, guard and sector-sign agreement
  with all 617 reference rules; serial/six-worker mathematical payloads are
  byte-identical;
- nine prepared ordinary sources, symbolic common squared mass `m`, and
  numerical search depth three;
- coordinate cases only for this workload: no exported affine `required`
  condition.

The 26 zero-sector masks and 38 nonzero-sector masks exhaust the 64 masks of
this family. The current cold audit independently authenticates the zero
classifications; the durable construction/loading boundary must retain that
check. A supplied mask list is not a proof that an integral vanishes.

An independent read-only structural audit additionally parsed every target
and excluded condition using only literal coordinate equality syntax. Every
guard is an OR of single-coordinate equations, with roots among `-1, 0, 1, 2`,
or the literal empty exclusion `false`. Partitioning each whole integer
orthant at all target, guard and residual values produced 7,632 exact cells:
7,594 are covered by a rule and the remaining 38 are precisely singleton
residual corners. There are zero uncovered cells in this **stored-guard
structural cover**. Unbounded interval cells were retained as intervals; this
was not a bounded sample-grid test. It does not yet discharge exact replay,
additional derivation divisors, uniform descent or zero-sector proofs.

A finite, nonminimal set of 38 terminals is acceptable. Finding no rule within
the numerical search budget does not prove a terminal independent, but
independence is unnecessary for a reduction onto a specified finite basis.
What must be proved is that every nonterminal target has an applicable exact,
strictly descending rule and that every resulting terminal has a supplied
evaluation. No positive-dimensional residual may be promoted to a terminal.

## Concrete gaps in the existing interfaces

### 1. Source provenance is not exported as an artifact certificate

`solver::RuleCandidate` retains selected `SeedSource` entries. Each entry
identifies a **sector-preconditioned** basis row and its original seed, not an
original ordinary IBP row. The text exporter omits this source support.
`canonicalize` then translates the winning pivot back to the canonical case
target without recording that final translation in `SeedSource`.

The compact support is enough to reconstruct a derivation, but it must not be
mistaken for a directly replayable original-source linear combination. A cold
bridge must regenerate the ordinary sources, reproduce the declared
preconditioning and selected translations, recover or retain the winning
target translation, and check the resulting exact identity against the
stored rule. Text equations alone are not the input to a trusted installer.

Preconditioning preserves the generic fraction-field row span, not every
exceptional specialized rank. Exact replay must respect the specialization
order and every necessary nonvanishing condition. It may use Symbolica's
native exact sparse reduction with source tracking at this cold boundary;
expanded source combinations must not be retained during hot modular search.

The normalized RHS exceptions do not, by themselves, record every divisor of
an exact derivation. If a replay certificate requires a divisor that vanishes
on an admitted integer case, either obtain a regular certificate there or
refine the exceptional domain and supply another rule. Merely clearing such
a divisor does not prove the divided identity on its zero locus. Whether
this adds any actual vac3 branches must be established by the first full
certificate pass, not assumed from the reference comparison.

### 2. The source-port ordering is genuinely different

Existing `sector::OrderingPolicy` uses ascending corner distance, then dots,
then numerators, followed by ascending coordinate excess. The source port
uses total absolute degree, then numerator degree, and the opposite
denominator-coordinate tie orientation; denominator and numerator tie passes
are also separated.

For example, the generated `001011` rule with target
`I(0,n1,1,n3,1,1)` and guards `n1 != 1`, `n3 != 0` contains

```text
(1/2) I(-1,n1,1,n3+1,1,1).
```

At `n1=-12`, `n3=-14`, this child is lower under the source-port ordering but
higher under the existing artifact ordering. Changing the coordinate
permutation alone is not a valid conversion.

Add an explicit persisted source-port ordering policy, including its
coordinate priority. For the initial uncut vacuum lane, its simpler-first
key is: active count, sector mask, total absolute degree, numerator degree,
then reversed positive-index values in priority order, then nonpositive-index
values in priority order. Avoid arithmetic negation of `i64::MIN` when
implementing reverse comparisons. The aggregate absolute degree has finite
level sets, so the coordinate tie reversals do not destroy well-foundedness.

Extend the existing concrete and symbolic shift-descent witnesses together.
Do not merely change the runtime comparator: the installer must prove the
same persisted order uniformly on each admitted guard cell.

### 3. Installation currently accepts other proof shapes

The existing installer is registered to the established K1/K3 proofs and the
older K6 sector-wave publication path. The latter expects its own wave
structure, factorization programs and terminal basis. A successful
`SectorSolution` cannot be inserted through those constructors unchanged.

Add a source-directed coordinate-program installation path under the same
`ClosedArtifact` ownership. Reuse family/context binding, exact rule and cell
types, source replay, zero analysis, geometric cover machinery, immutable
ownership, serialization and the reducer. Do not synthesize a fictitious old
K6 wave transcript or require the old minimal terminal list.

### 4. Family routing and common-mass normalization must be explicit

The matched C++/Rust reference fixture uses momenta

```text
[k1, k2, k3, k1+k2, k1+k3, k2-k3],    D_i = q_i^2 - m.
```

The existing unit-mass K6 artifact family uses

```text
[q1, q2, q3, q3-q1, q1-q2, q2-q3],    D_i = q_i^2 - 1.
```

They are related by the unimodular routing
`(q1,q2,q3)=(k1,-k2,-k3)` and interchange of denominator slots three and four
(zero-based). Authenticate this exact map if importing the existing family;
alternatively generate directly from the canonical unit-mass family and
validate that fresh campaign. Never identify families by a topology name.

Use native exact substitution for `m=1` and coefficient-context remapping.
For a general common squared mass `M2`, retain the existing homogeneity rule:
each master coefficient receives
`M2^(sum(master powers)-sum(target powers))` in addition to the common loop
normalization handled by Vakint. Negative numerator powers participate in
these sums. Do not confuse the reference's symbol `m` with an unsquared mass.

### 5. Vakint needs K6 assets and a complete terminal catalog

Vakint currently embeds K1/K3 assets, validates them once in `LazyLock`, and
passes a `ClosedArtifact` to `Reducer`. Its matching adapter does not yet
admit the K6 family. Preserve this load-once architecture.

The scalar contract remains exact coefficients keyed by typed `IntegralKey`
masters. All 38 finite corners may initially be retained. They can be mapped
offline to the existing MATAD master basis, or supplied through the existing
numerical Laurent terminal catalog with sufficient epsilon depth. An oracle
may evaluate this finite catalog during development; production generation,
loading and scalar application must not invoke the FORM reduction.

When K1/K3 assets are regenerated through the same source-directed installer,
bind their catalogs to the actual new terminal sets too. In particular, an
uncanonicalized K3 program retains all three pinch corners and the sunset
corner, whereas the present symmetry-canonicalized K3 asset has only two keys.
The three pinch values are the same tadpole square, but their typed keys must
all be listed if the new artifact retains them. Do not copy the old two-key
catalog or infer terminal identity from a matching loop count.

## Concrete installer slice: retained source certificate to existing owner

This is a proposed implementation boundary, not a claim that the current cold
diagnostic can already install or reload an artifact. Complete the remaining
ordinary-replay obligations first. Public audit counters are diagnostic data;
they must never be accepted as a publication token.

### One cold proof owner, not another reducer

The private `CheckedProgram` in
`foundry/artifact/source_port/program.rs` now owns the authenticated
family/indexed context, original-source recipe, deterministic sector/rule order,
exact application cover, finite terminal keys, zero-sector certificates and
per-rule original-source replay records. Its fields and constructor remain
private to this cold bridge. Its successful replay/descent/cover verifier returns
this consuming owner; unresolved guards, any uncovered complement (including
finite points not explicitly admitted as terminals), or budget failures cannot
construct it. It is neither a public `SectorSolution`
wrapper nor a second `ClosedArtifact`.

Per-rule records retain the exact original `RowId`, canonical target-relative
`i64` translation, normalization scale and native rational weight together
before filtering zero weights. They also retain the coordinate face and full
RHS. Fixed coordinates are specialized only after source translation; numeric
seed values need not equal the fixed target values. No preconditioned basis
ordinal, compact `Power`, GPLU state or search transcript is required in the
durable certificate.

The source adapter clears denominators using a native polynomial LCM. A weight
of that cleared row is not automatically a weight of the generator's original
`ParametricRelation`: preserve the clearing multiplier, or convert the weight
by that multiplier and verify the resulting exact relation. Source-condition
and all weight/RHS denominator obligations stay attached to the certificate.
Regenerating the same source rows and their scales must reproduce every
retained request; an ordinal without its `RowId` is insufficient.

### Combined-remainder semantics

For original translated rows `R_j`, normalized target identity `T`, and weights
`w_j`, the authority check computes the complete physical residual
`sum(w_j R_j) - T`, combining coefficients of equal integral keys with native
Symbolica arithmetic. No term is deleted first. For each remaining combined
term and every exact physical sign cell of the application cover, prove either
that its integral belongs to an independently certified zero sector or that
its coefficient vanishes identically after the cell's exact restrictions.
The target is never discarded merely because a discovery projection hid it.

An individually proved-product quotient is the cheap discovery lane. A more
permissive assumed-sector quotient may propose weights only after that lane
misses; the same full-residual check authenticates both. Finite activation
intervals may be exhaustively split into singleton integer coordinates under
an explicit budget. Every unbounded coordinate remains symbolic. Checking all
points of the exact two-point set `{-1,0}` is exhaustive; testing those points
on an infinite ray would not be. Zero numerators with identically zero
restricted denominators are rejected. Fresh applicability guards are checked
independently of serialized exclusions.

This proof sometimes exists only after weighted cancellation: individual raw
source terms need not vanish. Therefore do not encode such a certificate as
independent `ResidualTermDisposition` deletions. The implemented ownership
boundary keeps unchanged original translated rows as `SourceViewConstruction::Direct`
and puts the combined-remainder semantics exclusively in the rule's
`CombinedOriginalDomain` evidence. A private consuming constructor binds the
replayed rule and source batch together; the registered installer checks this
producer explicitly. This supersedes the earlier proposal for a second source
construction variant: the source rows themselves have not been projected.
Do not fabricate a symmetry canonicalizer or give a per-term projection proof
a weaker meaning. Fixed restrictions and combined remainder obligations remain
recomputable; cold verification can reconstruct sign partitions from the
domain and physical shifts without storing a redundant expanded proof tree.

### Lowering and runtime

The cohesive `source_port/lower/` module and narrow consuming installer in the
existing `artifact/install.rs` boundary use the certified program to
construct existing `ParametricRule`, `SourceViewBatch` and `Arc<RuleCell>`
payloads. Extend the private exact-replay construction seal to admit this
verified producer, preferably moving/renaming the current circuit-specific
`ExactCircuitLoweringSeal` to a neutral exact-replay boundary shared by both
producers. Never expose a public unchecked witness constructor or manufacture
an old physical-frame/wave transcript just to obtain the seal.

Compile guard-complement boxes with the existing unbounded `BoxCover` service.
For runtime rule cells, split at RHS sign walls and exact coefficient-dead
faces as needed to build the existing sector-monotone descent witnesses.
The full unbounded cover remains the publication proof; checked machine-index
bounds only delimit representable runtime inputs. Preserve deterministic
first-applicable rule priority and share immutable source/certificate data
across derived cells rather than cloning coefficient graphs for every cell.

The new installer reuses generic family/context, ordering, terminal,
zero-sector and rule-cell checks, then seals the same `ClosedArtifact`.
Initial ownership needs no factorization dependency or minimal-master proof:
the 38 finite parent-family corners can be explicit masters. The existing
`reduction::Reducer` continues to specialize coefficients, descend, memoize
and return exact typed-master decompositions. No certificate replay, source
generation or search enters its hot path. Sector-indexed dispatch may be
compiled once later if profiles justify it; the initial change need not add
another application engine.

### Canonical family and coefficient field

For the first shipped program, prefer generation directly from Vakint's
canonical unit-mass family. If transporting the already generated reference
program instead, authenticate the unimodular loop routing and denominator-slot
permutation described above, transform indices/guards/source requests/order
together, substitute the squared mass `m=1` natively, and rerun the full cold
proof against freshly generated canonical-family sources. Never permute only
the RHS or leave its ordering in the old slot convention.

Use the existing indexed coefficient context and native variable-map remapping
for the canonical field, not textual symbol replacement. Reject a denominator
that becomes zero during unit-mass specialization. Preserve generic dimension
dependence and explicitly retain parameter-locus conditions. Attach the
existing homogeneity proof so application restores a general common squared
mass with `M2^(sum(master powers)-sum(target powers))`, including negative
numerator powers. Runtime integral indices remain checked `i64` values.

### Codec, files and focused acceptance

Extend `artifact/persistence/mod.rs` and a cohesive
`artifact/persistence/source_port.rs` grammar under the current owner. Bump
`ArtifactSchemaVersion::CURRENT` from v4 to v5 and add one source-directed
algorithm identifier; update K1/K3 assets coherently rather than retain schema
compatibility shims. Reuse the existing bounded binary/coefficient codecs and
canonical content identity. Serialize family/context, source recipe and
normalization, exact weights/RHS, cases/guards, ordering, terminals and mass
metadata. Derived caches, native reducer arenas and validation timings are not
durable data.

Cold decode reconstructs native coefficients and original sources, verifies the
stored weighted identities and their exact domain/guard/descent/cover proofs,
and seals once. It must not rerun modular discovery, preconditioning search,
case solving, Janet completion or the reference executable. Invalid payloads
fail at this boundary; ordinary Vakint evaluation loads the immutable owner
once and never regenerates a campaign. New parser resource limits remain
explicit, but do not repeat expensive authentication per integral.

Required tests for this slice are original-row/offset/scale/weight mutation
rejection; full-remainder cancellation and finite-boundary negative controls;
guard and zero-census mutation; empty versus finite versus infinite cover;
canonical routing and native context remapping; mass-one specialization poles;
strict descent under the persisted ordering; deterministic serial/six-worker
bytes; fresh-process encode/decode plus canary reduction; memoization and
master-only output beyond the search encoding's compact range; nonunit-mass
restoration; and a decoder test proving no source finder was invoked. After
these pass, ship the asset and exact 38-key terminal catalog with Vakint and
run the separately maintained complete acceptance matrix. Each small lowering,
codec and application slice receives an independent audit before publication.

## Proposed bounded implementation ownership

Keep new work outside `solver`'s hot path:

1. `sector/ordering` and its shift/monotone witnesses: add the persisted
   uncut source-port ordering, exact concrete comparisons and uniform
   piecewise descent support. Retain the existing ordering variants for
   existing artifact producers; do not add wire-format compatibility shims.
2. `foundry/artifact/source_port/`: one cohesive cold bridge, split into
   provenance/replay, coordinate-cover compilation, installation and tests.
   It consumes typed sector solutions and authenticated family metadata.
   Tiny source-port accessor/provenance additions, if unavoidable, require
   root coordination; do not duplicate its search algorithm here.
3. Existing artifact model/codec: record the new algorithm and ordering,
   exact source provenance, case/guard ownership, finite terminals, zero
   certificates and homogeneity; bump the evolving schema as appropriate.
4. Existing `reduction` module: reuse iterative descent, memoization,
   coefficient specialization, typed masters and homogeneity. Prefer a
   sector-indexed rule dispatch table compiled once over scanning all 617
   rules for every target. Any indexing optimization must preserve declared
   deterministic rule priority.
5. Examples/campaign generation: an autonomous Rust-driven K6 artifact
   generator using family input only. Keep the old text example as a
   diagnostic interface, not an alternate trusted artifact reader.
6. GammaLoop/Vakint lane, owned separately: ship the resulting immutable
   K6 asset and terminal catalog, extend existing matching and comparative
   tests, then pin the corresponding RustRed revision at publication.

The exact public bridge function name may follow the existing artifact API,
but its semantic contract is:

```text
authenticated family + source recipe + complete sector solutions
  -> regenerate/replay + guarded descent + exact cover
  -> ClosedArtifact

ClosedArtifact + integer IntegralKey
  -> existing memoized Reducer
  -> exact typed-master decomposition
```

No artifact/application API may inherit the search port's compact `Power`
range. Runtime powers use the existing checked `i64` integral carrier, with
typed overflow errors and explicitly documented representability bounds.
The mathematical cover describes whole integer rays, not a finite test grid.

## Closure certificate for the first coordinate-only vacuum bridge

For each sector, form the complete integer parent orthant. Compile every
rule's fixed-coordinate case, exceptional OR-of-AND exclusions and exact
coefficient applicability into disjoint or overlapping application cells.
Preserve conjunction semantics: excluding `a=0 AND b=0` does not mean
excluding either hyperplane individually.

The actual vac3 coordinate geometry permits exact interval/box operations.
Reuse the existing box-cover service; split at fixed values, exceptional
coordinate values and RHS activation/pinch thresholds. Unbounded intervals
must remain unbounded. Where a coefficient vanishes on a boundary, prove
that fact by native exact substitution before omitting the associated term.

On every retained cell, prove each nonzero RHS child is either in a proper
lower sector or lower in the persisted source-port order in the same sector.
Check shifted active coordinates that pinch, inactive coordinates that could
activate, and fixed numerical RHS coordinates. A sampled interior comparison
is not this proof. The order must agree across all sector programs so that
cross-sector calls cannot form a cycle.

Independently subtract application cells, authenticated zero sectors and
explicit terminal points from the entire family domain. Publication requires
an empty complement. A finite remainder may be adopted as additional
terminals only after explicit policy admission and evaluation provisioning;
an infinite remainder is incomplete. Queue exhaustion, C++ agreement and
bounded numerical search alone are not substitutes for this cover check.

The initial importer may reject genuinely coupled affine/nonlinear case
ownership with a typed unsupported error. This is an artifact-bridge scope
limit, not a regression in the source solver's broader geometry support.

## Five-class Vakint coverage

The six full-rank K6 denominator-symmetry orbits contain two different
three-line embeddings that both describe a product of three tadpoles.
Consequently six family orbits correspond to five registered physical graph
classes, not six distinct required Vakint topologies.

Freeze and test the live matcher-derived census: the six-line parent, its
five-line contraction, both inequivalent four-line contractions, and the
three-line contraction. Use each class's actual simultaneous routing witness
and stable parent denominator slots. Check both three-line family embeddings
in the artifact even though Vakint exposes one physical class. The existing
artifact test manifest is useful evidence, but its stored historical matcher
revision is not a replacement for comparing today's matcher.

## Acceptance and first implementation gate

The complete cold rule-set pass now succeeds. Retain the same independent
obligations when materializing and loading the final artifact:

- original-source replay failures or additional exceptional obligations;
- ordering/descent failures, including the explicit old-order counterexample;
- uncovered cells after all rule guards and all 38 proposed terminals;
- independently authenticated zero sectors and the five-class routing census.

The current source workload passes these replay/descent/cover checks. Its
canonical durable installation and five-class Vakint routing still need
validation. Any newly exposed missing branches are actionable solver inputs,
not grounds for weakening the installer.

Required regressions include mutated source/seed/translation rejection,
guard-zero selection, empty/finite/infinite complement distinction, terminal
admission without an independence claim, rule cycles and activation edges,
indices outside compact search encodings, deterministic one/six-worker
payloads, cold serialization reload, master-only memoized output, and non-unit
mass restoration. All algebra uses Symbolica's native APIs; no rational
reconstruction implementation is introduced.

Vakint then runs every applicable single-scale acceptance case through three
loops in its existing comparative harness, including all five classes,
scalar and tensor-bearing inputs, and dotted/numerator cases. The full
FeynKit/RustRed path uses an invalid FORM path; separate FORM-enabled
AlphaLoop/MATAD runs remain the authoritative development oracle. A finite
nonminimal terminal basis may use numerical parity instead of identical raw
master labels, with the required Laurent precision checked explicitly.

The harness inventory finds 40 applicable single-common-mass
one- through three-loop entrypoints, expanding to 46 parameter/input executions
across the five legacy end-to-end files. These are configured inputs, not fresh
passing tests or 46 distinct integrals. With the added variants and documented
aliases, enabled native peers map to 25 entries / 31 executions and pending
K6 peers map to 15 entries / 15 executions. The new enabled one-loop variant
has not yet run. Eleven core three-loop bodies already have ignored
RustRed counterparts (five comparative, six analytic, eight tensor-bearing).
Four PySecDec-reference bodies duplicate existing analytic workloads and are
explicit aliases. Four previously missing settings/input variants now have
native peers: three pending three-loop comparative variants and the decorated
one-loop input at five epsilon terms. Two additional pending basketball peers
include the finite part and are not counted in the 40-entry legacy inventory.
PySecDec itself
stays non-gating; existing native AlphaLoop/MATAD or analytic references provide
the comparison. The new five-class fixtures supplement, not replace, these
reused acceptance bodies. Exclude the genuinely multi-mass two-loop input and
the misleadingly named decorated `1l` FMFT input that actually has four loops.

Profile generation, cold certification/loading and warm scalar application
separately. Reference-workload timing is not artifact-generation timing until
the proof and serialization boundary is included. Each implementation slice
receives a separate mathematical/implementation audit before its milestone
commit and push.

## Verified finite-terminal basis feasibility (2026-09-15)

This is a read-only feasibility result, not an installed terminal catalog, a
fresh artifact certificate, or a Vakint numerical acceptance pass. The 38
proposed undotted source-port terminals, after their documented transfer to
the canonical unit-mass parent family, require no additional independent MATAD
integral evaluation. Existing exact records and product identities suffice;
20,000-digit numerical tables are unnecessary for this particular basis.

An independent enumeration of the discrete `S4` edge action on the actual
38 candidate keys gives precisely the six existing `FULL_RANK_ORBITS`:

| Canonical parent representative | Keys in orbit | Exact terminal value source |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `(0,0,1,0,1,1)` | 12 | Three independent one-loop tadpoles |
| `(0,0,1,1,0,1)` | 4 | Three independent one-loop tadpoles |
| `(0,0,1,1,1,1)` | 12 | Two-loop sunset times one-loop tadpole |
| `(0,1,1,1,1,0)` | 3 | Existing four-line MATAD corner record |
| `(0,1,1,1,1,1)` | 6 | Existing five-line MATAD corner record |
| `(1,1,1,1,1,1)` | 1 | Existing six-line MATAD corner record |

The implementation evidence is in `three_loop/symmetry.rs`,
`three_loop/manifest.rs`, `three_loop/factorization.rs` and the existing
generic factorization installer. The two symmetry generators are authenticated
as exact momentum maps; their induced denominator permutations generate all
24 group elements. Product recipes are independently checked against every
denominator and a native determinant of `+1` or `-1`, with normalization one.
The two three-line orbits are not the same `S4` orbit, but their separate
unit-Jacobian factorization proofs give the same product value.

For the four-line product representative, the existing basis is
`q0=k3-k1`, `q1=k1-k2`, `q2=k3`: parent slots 4,5,6 form the sunset and slot 3
is the tadpole. The sunset's third momentum is `q0+q1=k3-k2`, whose square is
the required parent denominator. The two three-line recipes independently use
`(k3,k1-k2,k2-k3)` and `(k3,k3-k1,k2-k3)`. No determinant or Wick-sign factor
is silently introduced by these scalar changes of integration variables.

Use the existing unit-mass terminal conventions, with
`T1=-Gam(1,1)/(ep*(ep-1))` and `T2=-miT111`. The first two rows above have
value `T1^3`; the third has `T1*T2`, hence a positive
`Gam(1,1)*miT111/(ep*(ep-1))` product. The recently successful pre-existing
MATAD executable supplies the remaining three actual corner records:
the four-line value is `+miBN`, and the six-line value is `+miD6`.
The five-line value must be taken from its complete existing expression,
including its **outer minus sign**, then specialized and normalized natively;
no new hand-simplified formula is proposed here. Evidence is retained in
`target/vakint-existing-oracle-smoke.IbXhcU/stdout.log`. That run is an offline
oracle smoke check of an older executable, not a build of current GammaLoop.

The original records use the multiplicative FMFT/MATAD loop normalization.
Unit-mass terminal values contain no residual mass powers. Later Vakint
materialization restores `(m²)^(6-Σcorner)` and its existing `(m²)^(-3*ep)`
normalization; the scalar reducer separately supplies the documented
target-to-master homogeneity power. These factors must not be counted twice.

Before publishing the catalog, the following checks remain mandatory:

- Bind the **actual installed artifact's** complete typed terminal set and
  canonical unit-mass family, not just the earlier candidate CSV. The source
  fixture transfer uses `diag(1,-1,-1)` and exchanges denominator slots 3/4
  in zero-based indexing; all associated data must use the same convention.
- Classify every terminal through the existing native symmetry and installed
  product proofs and require exact key coverage, with no unexplained terminal.
  SpIReD's ordering may choose different orbit representatives: canonicalize
  both anchors and keys with the same policy, or compare their exact orbits.
- Parse and normalize the known MATAD expressions with Symbolica, preserving
  namespaces, epsilon/dimension conventions, poles, signs and existing master
  substitution controls. Reuse `TerminalCatalog` rather than another owner.
- Run cold-load, raw-master and numerical end-to-end comparisons, including
  nonunit mass and the FeynKit prepass followed by the FORM-free scalar tail.
  The five existing matcher classes must use their actual numerator-routing
  witnesses; equal denominator slot IDs alone do not imply equal loop bases.
