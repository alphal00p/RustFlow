# Retained owner source feedback

`RoutedFeedbackSession<N>` is an opt-in Rust application service. The existing
trace-only campaign and CLI keep their behavior. A session uses the ordinary
input-driven owner loader and native map verification once, retains the immutable
programs and routes, and accepts explicit prospective source-search policy and
resource limits through `RoutedFeedbackOptions`. This policy describes new work;
it does not assert historical settings absent from saved artifacts.

Each `run_round` traces the original finite entries through the shared worklist.
Only a successfully completed traversal can nominate source work, and only for
genuine `MissingRule` frontiers. A resource error or `MissingOwner` is never
converted into a source job or a new terminal.

By default (`PositiveRays`), a nominated domain fixes the observed inactive powers and leaves every active
power symbolic and positive. Exact owner-coordinate rays are deduplicated under
the session's fixed policy. The actual successor numerator rank is admitted,
including descendants above the entry rank; unsupported compact coordinates fail
explicitly. This is parametric source work over each nominated ray, not merely a
solve at the observed positive powers, and not an enumeration of the full R10
family domain.

The opt-in `RoutedFeedbackNomination::FixedTargets` policy instead preserves
**every** observed integer index. Same-owner points are searched in deterministic
batches through the existing `SearchFinite` solver; they are not widened into
infinite positive-power rays. `KeepUnresolved` is the default residual policy
and leaves a batch containing residuals uninstalled. The explicit
`DeclareSearchedFiniteTerminals` policy requires a positive numerical source
depth and a successfully completed search. Only fully fixed nominated residuals
can then be retained as a finite, nonminimal output convention. Receipts record
their exact keys, search depth and origin, separately from productive rules.
No failure, interrupted search or resource stop is converted into a terminal;
no independence or numerical value is claimed.

`replace_targets` atomically installs another bounded, nonempty input batch
without discarding source definitions, verified routes, installed overlays or
the policy ledger. Admission failure preserves the previous batch. Each round
still builds a fresh dependency graph: this is not persistent cross-batch memo
storage. A starting-domain budget never filters descendants. See
[finite starting domains](finite_starting_domains.md) for the input contract,
planning surfaces and remaining full-campaign work.

An optional `RoutedCampaignRequest::entry_domains_json` declares a finite union
of starting regions independently of the saved programs' generation rank.
The session retains it immutably, checks replacement batches atomically and
passes it to every native trace/retrace. Source checks and saved provenance
are unchanged; descendants and searched terminals are not tested against the
starting-domain restriction. See [explicit entry admission](shared_owner_campaign_driver.md#explicit-finite-starting-domains).

Jobs run serially through the core source-bound domain solver. Each completed
result passes raw-payload and cumulative overlay admission before atomic append
and route-preserving rebind. Base and earlier batch priorities remain unchanged.
The first failed job stops further searches; every remaining nomination is
recorded as unattempted. Earlier successful publications remain usable. A final
retrace, when appropriate, measures those retained updates. `programs()` exposes
the actual immutable updated programs, not just a diagnostic receipt.

Cancellation is cooperative: native calls are not interrupted. An unpublished
result is discarded if cancellation is observed after the call, and prior
publications survive. Every round starts a fresh trace graph; source definitions,
verified routes and generated rules are shared, but graph memo entries are not
resumed across rounds. Zero-frontier rounds do no source work.

Limits separately bound per-attempt search, nominations, the cumulative installed
ray ledger, one staged raw result and cumulative prepared overlays. Native payload
accounting is not a hard transient-allocation/RSS guarantee. Error text is formatted
directly into a UTF-8 byte cap with an explicit truncation flag. The admitted
retained JSON envelope also allows for escaping, job metadata and trace snapshots;
it does not bound observer history retained by a caller.

`feedback_round_complete` describes the bounded round's operations, while
`completed_finite_trace` requires a completed final traversal with zero frontier.
Neither asserts all-family closure or master minimality. There is no coefficient
back-substitution, durable overlay resume, complete-sector artifact fabrication,
or automatic full-rank-domain enumeration in this slice. Repeated rounds can use
the retained parametric rules to expose and address further genuine rule gaps.
