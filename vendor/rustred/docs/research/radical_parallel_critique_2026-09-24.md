# Radical parallel architectures: independent adversarial review

24 September 2026. This is a second-agent assessment, not the first architect's
summary. I formulated hypotheses from the audited measurements before receiving
its fresh proposals, then challenged the proposed ownership and proof boundaries
directly. No production change, build or native workload was performed for this
review. The earlier [independent review](ibp_generation_independent_critique_2026-09-24.md)
and [paired cover evidence](finite_cover_pilot_2026-09-24.md) remain the factual
baseline. The separate [fresh architecture proposal](radical_parallel_architecture_2026-09-24.md)
was read after the initial hypotheses and direct adversarial exchange.

## Verdict

The most consequential choice is **which obligations to share**, not how many
workers to launch. Shared phase-labelled regions have positive measured evidence.
Independent entry shards are a genuinely competing design: deliberately repeat
some work to remove coordination dependencies. Neither is uniformly superior.

My initial recommendation was a bounded all-owner sharing control, then a small
exact-entry-shard falsifier. The sharing pair has now stopped inconclusively, and
its expensive shared early anchor defeats the unchanged shard recipe. The
post-pair update below supersedes that order: profile the costly initial Apply
phase first, then conditionally test one bounded outbox change against completed
same-scope work. Do not commission an epochal runtime or guard compiler from
blocked-worker counts alone.

There is no evidence supporting a promised 50-core speedup, an all-67 completion
ETA, or a universal invariant. There is also no justification for abandoning the
finite generic envelope in favor of only encountered QCD diagrams, cutting
descendants, or changing difficult cases into newly authorized terminals.

## What the evidence actually constrains

The stopped campaign was saved-rule coverage traversal, **not IBP discovery**:
8.27 million native inspections, 10.41 million pending obligations, 1.447 billion
events and about 235 GB peak RSS. Its zero observed frontiers describe a prefix.
The memory breakdown between native algebra, queue/index, obligations and retained
diagnostics is unknown. A small output format alone cannot be credited with
removing the whole peak.

The strongest same-required-scope pair is presently A12 with fixed P13 Apply/Route
anchors, all four original roots and every escaping descendant retained:

| Metric | Direct A12 | Fixed anchors + original A12 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Traversal | 22.387674 s | 11.720009 s |
| Whole-command CPU | 174.73 s | 128.34 s |
| Peak RSS | 1,403,176 KiB | 771,516 KiB |
| Native inspections | 62,562 | 23,863 |
| Containment charges | 250,297,311 | 37,948,002 |
| Attempted native operations | 12,313,872 | 12,519,140 |

This single fresh-process pair supports responsibility sharing and reduced
fragmentation/coordination. It does not prove that inner algebra got cheaper:
attempted native operations increased 1.67%. The same fixed anchors lost to
direct traversal on smaller A11. Extra coarse-domain work can outweigh sharing.
Represented descendants reach P=17; the anchors are not certified invariant, and
those conservative domains are not individual concrete reachability witnesses.

Other results constrain the story too. Forty inspectors did not establish a wall
gain over the default 25; 48 were slower. A correct duplicate-projection shortcut
did not yield material speedup. Conversely, native substitution reordering nearly
halved matched wall time while reducing CPU. Neither a plausible hotspot nor
increased occupancy predicts useful completed-work speedup.

### No numerical Amdahl fraction has been measured

For fixed work W and critical-path span S, an ideal p-processor execution obeys
T(p)≥max(W/p,S). Under the separate simplified model with an unchanged serial
fraction f, speedup is at most 1/(f+(1−f)/p). These are models, not measured values
of f or S for RustRed. Amdahl's original discussion emphasizes data-management
overhead and irregularity; its historical numerical assumptions are not
transferable here. [Original paper, reprinted by IEEE](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~rezaul/Spring-2012/CSE613/reading/Amdahl-1967.pdf).

The recorded 4.31 seconds of ordered commit and 2.75 seconds of helper preparation
are overlapping coordinator-wall observations, not exclusive serial CPU that can
be inserted into this formula. Route accounts for about 61% of A12 inspections,
not 61% of CPU. Whole-command CPU, post-load traversal and heartbeat-labelled busy
cores have different timing boundaries. Do not divide unlike windows or sum
overlapping speculative/ordinary containment accounting.

Work-stealing guarantees also have hypotheses. The classical Blumofe–Leiserson
time/space bounds concern fully strict computations; the work/span quantities
are useful here, but RustRed's shared pending regions, aliases and global
obligation graph are not automatically such a computation. A theorem about a
scheduler does not establish cheap containment, bounded coefficient growth or a
well-founded mathematical reduction. [Primary paper](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~cappello/190B/papers/CilkJACMp720-blumofe.pdf).

## Five distinct designs, with counterexamples

### 1. Demand-trained regional services — strongest near-term direction

Replace a path-specific request history by immutable, phase-labelled source
regions whose complete ordered inspection and outgoing obligations are shared.
The stronger variant learns candidate service regions from exact demand waves,
then freezes and checks them in a fresh run. This could avoid paying for every
one of the 57,554 proposed all-owner P13 anchors when few are useful.

The relevant independence is **local inspection before downstream completion**.
It is not an independent closed owner shard. A region can be pending yet serve
as a containment destination because its responsibility remains outstanding.
Complete local inspection and global closure are separate states. Existing native
ordered guards, original denominators, zero-term handling, nonzero-child validity,
conditional images and route authority remain mandatory.

**Counterexample:** a training prefix sees many easy parents sharing one route,
but a late exceptional entry needs a costly, previously unseen interface. A
sampled service inventory cannot exclude that work. A broader inferred service
may cross guard/pole faces or inspect irrelevant points, as the A11 loss already
illustrates. Ordinary exact fallback and all escapes must remain.

Work may increase through broad proof regions; a few large services can lengthen
span; native coefficients and buffered publication can erase history-memory
savings. Charge training and cold checking. A warm-cache-only improvement is not
an improvement to this one unfinished cold delivery. Repeated future reuse can
be reported separately, with an explicit amortization assumption.

### 2. Independent exact entry shards — real independence, deliberately less sharing

Partition E exactly into disjoint native-representable initial regions. Each shard
owns its complete descendant closure and local ledger under the same immutable
rules, routes and terminal policy. A union of completed shards covers E without
cross-shard admission/commit. This is fundamentally different from assigning one
thread to each owner: every shard may visit many of the same owners.

**Counterexample:** every shard descends into the same expensive lower-owner
region. The current shared walker inspects it once; k independent shards may
inspect it k times. The positive A12 sharing result makes this a serious risk,
not an expected speedup. Equal initial tuple counts do not balance guarded proof
cost, so one hard shard may still dominate makespan.

The tradeoff is lower coordination span against more CPU and memory. Separate CLI
processes also duplicate loaded programs; a later shared immutable in-process
implementation could avoid some copies, but that hypothetical saving cannot be
credited to the first measurement. All coordinators, helpers, owner loading and
simultaneously live result buffers belong in one aggregate resource budget.

Completion is an AND over every shard, not “most shards finished.” A failed or
capped shard leaves E incomplete. Entry partitioning never partitions away that
shard's descendants or excuses missing routed owners. Merging summaries does not
authenticate a changed snapshot or recreate original IBP provenance.

### 3. Epochal regional dataflow — plausible commit redesign, not yet justified

Freeze an admitted frontier and inspect its local regions in parallel; batch
native inclusion/deduplication and successor publication at epoch boundaries.
The intended saving is fewer fine-grained global commits and better batching,
possibly accepting some duplicate work to shorten synchronization.

**Counterexample:** one broad guard region is a straggler. A global epoch barrier
makes every other worker wait and retains a wave of outgoing regions or algebra
objects. The subsequent union/containment pass can become a larger trusted serial
commit than today's streaming path. If adjacent parents emit the same Route
domain, a design that speculates before deduplication can duplicate work the
current pending-domain index already shares.

Within-rule priority remains ordered even if unrelated regions publish in batches.
Each outgoing responsibility needs idempotent identity and complete publication;
durable local completion cannot precede durable successor obligations. A batch
hash is not a proof. Exact union subtraction is not free in native A/R/D geometry;
fragmentation needs a budget and ordinary-work fallback, not silent approximate
subtraction. Global work/event limits must count attempted and abandoned work
honestly; changing the failure prefix requires explicit semantics, not hiding
over-budget speculative effects.

**Verdict:** defer implementation until actual exclusive commit cost or observed
dependency delays justify it. Do not import an Amdahl fraction from overlapping
timers, or replace a single ordered bottleneck with periodic stop-the-world work.

### 4. Guard-carrying relational reachability — more than a predicate cache

The strongest proposal represents exact disjunctions and source-to-target
relations in a shared graph, retaining source predicates and coefficient-nonzero
conditions rather than propagating only target boxes. This changes the object
being proved, not merely the cache key. A constant shift can carry its exact
source preimage; a later guard may then avoid a branch introduced only by an
over-cover. Compiled ordered predicate/transfer nodes and native affine charts
are possible building blocks, not a complete entailment engine.

I accept the conceptual advantage but reject an unsupported diagnosis: current
Apply already retains its exact translated box/rank/A/D geometry. Its conditional
coefficient dependencies and routed over-covers are potential extra-work sources;
how much cost they cause remains unmeasured. Native guarded application nominates
one rule, uses borrowed objects and does not admit general A/D bounds. Numerator
routing can expand polynomial terms; it is not generally an invertible exponent
map. A queue-owned ordered relational program therefore needs new proof plumbing,
not a drop-in swap of today's domain type.

**Counterexamples:** a path graph accumulates distinct translated guard predicates
at each step, so exact relational sharing degenerates into an expanding formula.
Boolean/disjunction growth and integer feasibility tests can cost more than
checking the conservative cover. For the caching subproblem, two queries fix the
same indices to different values. A
numerator or pole vanishes at only one; a layout-only key is unsound, while a
correct value-sensitive key may never hit. Rule232/239 examples also show why an
unknown earlier guard cannot authorize a later rule on the whole box. A globally
disjoint truth partition can grow exponentially, moving work into compilation.

Cold compilation, relational entailment, node storage and a hot difficult leaf can dominate
work, RAM and span. The sampled difficult guards are affine diagonals, but the
A12 controls use only 66/68 finite-refinement cells: repeated diagonal splitting
is not established as the main cost. Expensive repeated expression restrictions
must be measured with actual values, immutable context and limits before caching.
Unknown/refused algebra is not a predicate proof; existing native conditional
over-cover and optional fallback can still be successful behavior.

Preserve whole excluded conjunctions, first-applicable priority and original
source/pole authority. A compact SCC is not a termination argument; exact unknown
implication must leave an obligation or invoke the old visitor. Failure to express
a necessary implication through audited native APIs rejects that implementation
route, not the finite-entry goal. No general Boolean/integer solver is presumed.

Do not fuse away a shared Route responsibility indiscriminately. M parents sharing
one route can become M route evaluations, with larger cached polynomial images.
Use native Rust/Symbolica operations; no string-based or substitute CAS is proposed.

### 5. Discovery portfolios and downstream-aware generation — separate strategic lane

For genuinely missing relations, vary existing source orders or independent
modular scouts, task exceptional cases or exact row blocks, and select rules by
total downstream economics. A block/cut formulation can reduce equation work,
but requires reconstruction of the complete uncut requested relation and all its
source/exceptional conditions.

**Counterexamples:** a one-term rule with 1/(n0−n1) creates more exceptional work
than a two-term pole-free relation; a cut removes a boundary coupling equation;
a special modular point exhibits a rank not valid generically. Fast local success
does not settle program priority, domain coverage or exact identity.

Losing scouts increase work, dependent pivots retain span, and worker-local matrices
or exact coefficients multiply RAM. Replacing a rule invalidates affected program
coverage receipts. This lane is legitimate long-term research, but saved-rule
closure currently does no such search. Implementing a new discovery engine now
has an opportunity cost against the measured sharing improvement and unfinished
delivery; it should require a real generation bottleneck or missing target first.

## Two prospective discriminatory pilots, before the all-owner result

The post-pair update below supersedes this initial ordering; the first pilot
has now stopped inconclusively, and the unchanged second pilot is not promoted.

Neither is automatic execution authorization. Freeze inputs, snapshot, resources
and rejection gates prospectively; a resource stop is an incomplete diagnostic,
not a mathematical failure of the required E.

1. **Bounded all-owner sharing control.** Finish the generic input/index slice and
   compare one predeclared bounded 67-owner E with and without fixed P13 anchors,
   retaining all original roots and escapes. The full A24/R15/D9 goal remains
   unchanged, but this is not its automatic restart. Verify actual index status:
   339 Apply anchors plus 67 roots need only 406 eligible index entries; 57,215
   Route anchors remain real queue obligations. Charge expanded input admission,
   cold load, native work, output and cleanup. Record completion, whole wall/CPU,
   peak aggregate RSS, longest inspection, native/containment counts, failed
   source checks, conditional/support counts and retained obligations. Stop at
   predeclared equal work/memory gates with no extension. The proposed all-owner
   A12 control uses 375,000 scheduled records, 250,000 returned native inspections
   and 15,000,000 events, below unchanged native 500,000/50,000,000 domain/event
   limits. A stop establishes only feasibility failure under that diagnostic
   budget; if both stop, the speed comparison is inconclusive. Only completed
   comparisons support a wall/CPU/RAM tradeoff claim. Do not widen P or promote a
   failed extra point to an E counterexample. A single pair is a falsifier, not a
   stable speed estimate.

2. **At most two exact entry shards against the winning shared reference.** On an
   already completed scope such as A12, choose a deterministic native integer
   cut before timing and verify disjoint union equals E. For example, preserve
   all other predicates and split D≥9 into 9≤D≤10 and D≥11. Retain the
   same fixed anchors in each shard if the reference uses them, explicitly charging
   their duplicate checking; retain every shard's descendants. Only the required
   E partition is disjoint: duplicated anchors and descendant closures may overlap.
   Compare fresh cold
   reference completion with concurrent shard completion under one total CPU and
   memory allowance, including both coordinators/helpers and all process trees.
   Record makespan, summed CPU/native work, simultaneous peak RSS, duplicate
   regions, slowest-shard fraction and final ledger/runtime-support status. Freeze
   a global attempted-work ceiling, for example twice the measured winning
   reference's work, before release; exceeding it stops the pilot without raising
   limits. Reject feasibility under that budget if duplication/memory breaches
   the allowance; do not infer an algorithm-wide verdict from a stopped prefix.
   A completed comparison must meet a prospectively specified material-gain
   threshold. Any acceptable CPU-for-wall trade must be declared beforehand.
   Repeat only to establish a promising observed effect, not to tune the split
   until a favorable result appears.

These compare opposite economic hypotheses—share more versus coordinate less—
without first implementing a new closure engine. If neither wins, that is useful
negative evidence. Measure costly repeated interior operations and actual serial
span within an approved follow-up before investing in epochs or an automaton.
Do not substitute a busier machine for completed same-required-scope work.

## Authority and final decision boundary

All designs must preserve native first-applicable guards, original denominator
and source-condition authority, native zero handling, retained conditional
children, exact routed obligations, concrete descent/phase compatibility and
globally discharged responsibilities. Pending mutual inclusion is not a cyclic
proof of termination. Existing complete-walk support counters observe final
successor attempts; they neither audit every original term nor replace the
route/runtime contract. Zero on a stopped prefix proves nothing.

A compact portable manifest may replace chronological history only if it binds
the immutable programs, required E, checked responsibilities, escaping transfers
and permitted terminals. It must support the existing cold-runtime handoff, not
silently strengthen saved-formula provenance. No second full walk or universal
unbounded theorem is imposed as a new goal gate by this review.

My initial ranking was conditional and independent: measured sharing first;
exact entry sharding as a cheap competing falsifier; epochal commits and guarded
automata behind evidence of their particular cost; new discovery architecture
behind an actual discovery workload. The following evidence revises the next
experiment, not the unfinished full generic 67-owner goal.

## Post-pair challenge: admission worked, completion remains unmeasured

The [audited all-owner comparison](all_owner_regional_sharing_2026-09-24.md)
ended with both variants cancelled at the predeclared scheduled-work gate. The
index genuinely retained 67 versus 406 Apply members while every Route input
remained an obligation. Anchored execution locally discharged all 67 required
roots, but still had 268,836 queued responsibilities and unresolved descendant
dependencies. Direct execution retained all roots, including six unpublished
handles. Neither is a completed reduction of E. Zero observed frontiers and
unsupported-support counters on these prefixes do not change that conclusion.

The 61 versus 105,514 published native inspections are not a useful-throughput
ratio: anchored work is predominantly routing, additional initial work differs,
and cancellation overshoot and pending obligations differ. Likewise its longer
elapsed time is not a completed-scope slowdown. Whole-command measurement pays
parsing/loading/admission/output, but offline input construction and pre/post
hash audits remain outside that timer. Native preparation alone is about 102
seconds in each process, making duplicated cold services economically relevant.

**A concrete objection now weakens my original shard pilot.** The anchored trace
spends an extended early interval on the same additional anchor ID1, A≤7/R≤6
without a D floor. Partitioning only required E while copying every fixed anchor
to each shard duplicates that entire anchor; it does not divide its observed
span. Splitting or demand-selecting anchors may be worthwhile, but is a different
unchanged-E design whose lost sharing, repeated algebra, loading and storage
must be charged. I therefore do not recommend immediately executing the original
duplicated-anchor shard comparison.

The blocking evidence also does not justify micro-epochs. An epoch can wait for
the same long producer while retaining every other output. In one observed
early interval roughly 24 inspectors wait while committed events still advance;
the measured coordinator CPU and commit timer do not demonstrate coordinator
saturation. In another interval, 255 jobs are already finished, zero producers
are blocked and the current head still controls progress. Active-worker counts,
returned jobs and cumulative worker-wait seconds are not completed useful work,
CPU fractions or an Amdahl decomposition. Individual inspectors are not mapped to
domain IDs in these samples, so head-thread attribution remains unavailable.

A bounded larger running outbox is a smaller falsifiable alternative for the
first regime, not a cure for the second. The separate completed-result escrow
cannot accept an unfinished stream. Extra capacity helps only if enough visitors
can finish/recycle within it or overlap a limiting head; otherwise it retains
more speculative prefixes, increases cancellation waste, and postpones the same
stall. Spare RAM does not establish a wall-time benefit, and all private,
published, completed and coordinator-held storage needs a declared aggregate
bound. No buffer feature is implemented or authorized by this review.

My next recommendation is one separately approved process-local profile of the
same frozen expensive initial Apply phase, with its cold cost and profiling
overhead explicit. If that supports a buffer bottleneck, test one bounded-outbox
counterfactual on a prospectively fixed **completed** reference scope. Demand
same-required-scope completion and improved end-to-end wall under the declared
CPU/RAM tradeoff, not merely fewer blocked workers or more returned speculative
jobs. If only censored prefixes are affordable, report mechanism evidence and
leave completion speed unknown. This is preferable to committing to epochs,
independent services or a new relation-discovery engine on the present evidence.
