# K6 exact boundary walk: audited transient results

## Authority and claim boundary

This note is the authoritative record of the audited K6 boundary-walk
measurements captured on 2026-09-01. It records exact progress by the current
proposal-only discovery and owner-admission machinery. It is **not** evidence
of a closing K6 artifact, a completed probe program, or practical scaling to
K21. The measurement driver was a transient harness; its results are retained
here as research evidence rather than as a durable acceptance test.

No oracle support, coefficient, or rule was supplied. Candidate rows were
regenerated from ordinary sources, lifted and replayed exactly, and admitted
only through the existing guard, descent, executable-owner, and exact
`BoxCover` authority boundaries. The exact compiler remained non-closed and
no K6 artifact was published.

## Audited walk

For one immutable owner-ledger snapshot, the walk orders effective residual
dimension `r` from high to low. Within an `r` class it orders parent free
dimension `d` from high to low and uses boundary codimension `c = d - r`.
Pinned-axis subsets, finite-axis assignments, and simplex offsets are all
canonical. Positive-dimensional classes use the degree-zero simplex profile
with positive margin two; `r = 0` uses the typed vertex profile. Any admitted
owner changes the ledger revision, invalidates every sibling task from the old
snapshot, and causes an exact replan.

At the authenticated starting snapshot, revision 9 had 9 owners and 28 exact
uncovered boxes. Its free-dimension histogram for `d = 0..6` was
`[0, 0, 0, 0, 25, 3, 0]`. The nine starting owners were themselves regenerated,
replayed, and admitted exactly without oracle rules, supports, or
coefficients; they were not supplied as trusted input to the boundary walk. A
complete degree-zero schedule at that *unchanged* snapshot would have been:

| effective `r` | parent classes `(d,c)` | boundary faces | tasks |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| 4 | `(5,1)`, `(4,0)` | 40 | 103 |
| 3 | `(5,2)`, `(4,1)` | 130 | 382 |
| 2 | `(5,3)`, `(4,2)` | 180 | 558 |
| 1 | `(5,4)`, `(4,3)` | 115 | 367 |
| 0 | `(5,5)`, `(4,4)` | 28 | 91 |
| **total** |  | **493** | **1,501** |

The previously revalidated maximal-interior `(5,0)` bulk class contributes
three additional tasks. The table is a fixed-revision planning census, not a
claim that either transient run completed it: every successful mutation
replaced the snapshot and restarted canonical planning on new geometry.

## Captured measurements

Both measurements used `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` and began from the revision-9
snapshot above. The stop in both cases was the report cap.

| report cap | stop | runtime | plans | final revision | owners | boxes | stale siblings | final free-dimension histogram `d=0..6` |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 512 | `ReportCap` | 87.84 s | 86 | 40 | 40 | 84 | 31 | `[0, 0, 0, 65, 17, 2, 0]` |
| 2,048 | `ReportCap` | 379.11 s | 217 | 74 | 74 | 109 | 63 | `[0, 0, 17, 76, 14, 2, 0]` |

| report cap | no nomination | duplicate | strict geometric shrink | changed without geometric shrink | no rebased circuit | incomplete | closed |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 512 | 274 | 207 | 17 | 14 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2,048 | 1,029 | 954 | 28 | 37 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The owner and revision increases are exact admissions: 31 mutations in the
512-report run and 65 in the 2,048-report run. Increasing box counts do not
contradict exact cover shrinkage; subtracting an admitted owner may fragment a
canonical complement into more boxes. The migration from dimensions four and
five toward dimensions two and three is useful geometric progress, but it is
not a monotone volume measure and does not establish closure.

Neither run reached one unchanged snapshot on which the declared probe
program was exhausted. `ReportCap` is therefore neither exhaustion nor
closure, and stale-sibling counts are expected consequences of transactional
revision invalidation. Only `CompilerClosed` can establish closure. The
transient harness dropped each full task report after extracting its target,
scalar fields, and compact census, but still retained those compact records in
`O(reports)` memory rather than using a bounded window. Its retention model is
therefore not the intended production design; the measurements do not
establish a causal explanation for the observed RSS trend. The plan counts are
restart telemetry across changing ledger revisions, not counts of classes
exhausted at one stable snapshot.

## Durable deterministic checkpoint

### Fresh-ledger CLI ordering controls (2026-09-02)

The later public `campaign run` boundary was also exercised from a fresh
owner-free orbit-zero ledger with an optimized release binary.  Unlike the
older revision-nine checkpoint above, this coordinator replans after every
admission and each report in these prefixes committed one newly replayed
owner.  These are transient search measurements, not artifact-generation
times.  In particular, the executable preceded the final aggregate exact-
guard preflight hardening, so any eventual closing result must be regenerated
and replayed with the hardened binary before it can be certified.

| proof ordering | proposal priority | cap | core time | exact owners | exact strict shrinks | final boxes | terminal task `(class,r,d,c,task)` |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| natural | natural | 512 | 83.416 s | 512 | 512 | 2,015 | `(4,3,4,1,29)` |
| natural | `[5,3,4,2,0,1]` | 512 | 84.959 s | 512 | 512 | 1,952 | `(4,3,4,1,1302)` |
| `[5,3,4,2,0,1]` | `[5,3,4,2,0,1]` | 512 | 84.122 s | 512 | 512 | 1,981 | `(4,3,4,1,785)` |

All three prefixes stopped only at the request for report 513.  They recorded
zero duplicate, no-proposal, incomplete-proposal, modular-hit, support-lift,
canonical-query, exact-obstruction, and guard-incomplete outcomes.  Coverage
remained `Incomplete(NonFinite)`, no artifact was published, and all three
reports retained one explicit terminal.  The externally selected priority
therefore improves this particular box-count proxy by only about 3.1 percent
over the strict no-hint control and does not move the terminal task to a lower
effective dimension at this cap.  Changing only the ordering is not yet a
closure breakthrough.

The distinction between the first and latter two rows is an audit boundary,
not algebraic authority.  The first row is the autonomous control.  The latter
rows are external-hints-only runs: the six-coordinate priority may have been
inferred from FORM behavior, but RustRed regenerated every ordinary IBP,
coefficient, guard, replay witness, and owner.  No FORM right-hand side,
coefficient, solved rule, or reduction result entered the campaign.  Both
lanes remain subject to the identical zero-uncovered, strict-descent,
serialization/reload, and representative-reduction gates.

### Four-probe replay of the first long-run rejection

A release-build external-hints-only replay used the coherent proof and
proposal priority `[5,3,4,2,0,1]`, margin two, degree zero, and the four
declared probes `(1000000007,37)`, `(1000000007,31)`,
`(1000000009,37)`, and `(1000000009,31)`. The executable SHA-256 was
`5bb1d994ab97deeac269d24fabb8ae589c983d409333339d41b72bf6a47fa18b`.
It reproduced 736 exact owners and strict geometric shrinks, then rejected all
four probes at the same stable location
`(revision=736,class=4,r=3,d=4,c=1,task=1371)`. Core time was 222.589 s; the
residual cover had 2,773 boxes, remained non-finite, and published no
artifact.

This excluded an isolated failure of the original `(1000000007,37)` sample,
but that binary retained only the aggregate rejection count. The subsequent
typed replay below resolved the ambiguity; no task was skipped toward a false
exhaustion claim.

The subsequent typed release replay used executable SHA-256
`4e13d343637bff05fc52e4037e3a2f09c48ab737922a83acb5762026c2659942`
and one probe. It again stopped after the same 736 strict shrinks at the same
task in 174.838 s. The retained rejection is
`source-discovery / obstruction-nomination / shift-overflow`. The blocker is
therefore not a finite-field singularity or an ordering-dependent modular
sample: iterative inverse-incidence nomination has reached an unrepresentable
machine-carrier translation. More prime sweeps could not address this failure.

The corrected carrier now derives the complete componentwise expansion
envelope from the same scheduler limit used by the probe adapter. For the nine
ordinary K6 rows, the repeatable physical stencil is `q-s in [-2,2]^6` and the
one-shot request suffix is `-s in [-1,1]^6`. A 4,096-epoch probe can materialize
residual translations at physical depth 4,097, so the exact envelope is
`[-8194,8194]^6`. The largest source-safe chart endpoints are therefore
`9223372036854767613` on active axes and `9223372036854767614` on inactive
axes. Endpoint maximality and every bounded physical/request prefix are
regression-tested.

### Post-fix hinted and autonomous report-737 replays

The optimized executable SHA-256 was
`123b647d007ae75c1b60d312bb770620d949d0e8605461936f55702394bf736d`.
Both replays used one thread, `(1000000007,37)`, margin two, degree zero, and a
strict V2 configuration. The external-hints-only run used proof/proposal order
`[5,3,4,2,0,1]`; the autonomous document contained only the preset and report
ceilings, so RustRed derived its natural ordering and probe program internally.

| lane | core time | exact owners/shrinks | scheduler rejections | boxes | stop after report 737 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| external hints only | 182.644 s | 737 | 0 | 2,776 | report cap at `(revision=737,class=4,r=3,d=4,c=1,task=1293)` |
| autonomous | 176.256 s | 737 | 0 | 2,753 | report cap at `(revision=737,class=4,r=3,d=4,c=1,task=254)` |

Thus the former revision-736 shift overflow is gone in both claim-bearing
paths. Every report replayed canonically and strictly shrank the exact cover;
neither run reported a budget stop, stall, exact-lift error, or sampled dual.
Both covers remain non-finite, neither compiler closed, and neither run
published an artifact. These are deterministic progress measurements, not a
K6 closure or scaling claim.

The campaign input firewall is now structural rather than a caller-selected
label. Autonomous callers cannot supply an ordering, probe, seed, or domain;
external hints occupy a separate typed object that cannot represent a FORM
right-hand side, coefficient, source row, support, solved rule, or reduction.
Both paths discard search provenance before the same proof-wave and artifact
installer. The installer independently regenerates the canonical nine-row
ordinary module and rejoins every direct, fixed-index, and residual-projection
source view before generic replay/descent validation.

The next practical closure seam is a production-neutral requested-domain
phase followed by the existing generic boundary complement. The hinted lane
will accept only canonicalizable `anchor_powers + symbolic_axes` search
metadata; the autonomous lane will derive leader domains and select an
ordering through a deterministic internal portfolio, then restart the proof
campaign from a fresh root. The current 55 AlphaLoop LHS entries and their 27
canonical domains remain test-only diagnostics until that typed seam exists.

Commit `ac68736` preserves a bounded, oracle-disabled regression that rebuilds
the authenticated revision-nine ledger by executing ordinary-source probes,
then performs two independent 80-report boundary walks. Both walks reproduce
the same canonical plan/task transcript, exact owner content keys, and exact
uncovered partition. Each reaches revision 18 with 18 owners and 39 boxes,
with free-dimension histogram `[0, 0, 0, 17, 20, 2, 0]`. The outcome census is
33 no-nomination, 38 duplicate, 6 changed-without-geometric-shrink, and 3
strict-shrink reports, with no incomplete proposal, replay failure, or exact
obstruction. Nine mutations are followed by exact replanning and an
independently checked stale-sibling rejection.

The regression was independently audited and reproduced. Its typed stop is
deliberately `ReportCap`, and its compiler status is deliberately
`Incomplete(NonFinite)`: it proves deterministic exact progress, not closure
or schedule exhaustion. In particular, the test-only stable-sweep telemetry
must not be promoted into a production exhaustion certificate until the stop
policy retains canonical replay-attempt/query-rejection evidence and exact
obstruction/refinement state.

Commit `e12f4a5` independently reproduces the same checkpoint through the
compact production coordinator without retaining the diagnostic transcript.
Its cumulative census has 10 immutable epochs, 20 materialized plans, 80 task
reports, and 135 invalidated plan-suffix tickets. It stops at the typed request
for report 81 against the declared limit 80, at revision 18 and canonical
location `(class=0,r=5,d=5,c=0,task=1)`. Of the 80 coordinator-owned D37 probes, 47
replayed canonically and 33 completed with modular support that did not lift;
all stalls, rejections, exact-lift errors, canonical query rejections,
incomplete proposals, and exact obstructions are zero. A support-lift miss is
therefore retained as an exact finite-program outcome, not misclassified as
an operational/refinement failure and never promoted to closure evidence.

Commit `34b6243` adds an ignored 256-report checkpoint whose single test
performs two fresh authenticated revision-nine reconstructions. Both agree
exactly and reach revision 29 with 29 owners, 56 uncovered boxes, and
free-dimension histogram `[0, 0, 0, 37, 17, 2, 0]`. Its outcomes are 138
no-proposal, 98 duplicate, 8 changed-without-geometric-shrink, and 12
strict-shrink reports. All incomplete-proposal, scheduler-failure,
canonical-rejection, and exact-obstruction counters remain zero. The typed
stop requests report 257 against limit 256 at
`(revision=29,class=2,r=4,d=4,c=0,task=3)`. This is another deterministic
report-cap prefix, not schedule exhaustion; in particular, two dimension-five
uncovered boxes still remain.

Commit `398b190` extends the durable evidence to 512 reports. Its ignored test
again performs two fresh authenticated revision-nine reconstructions and
agrees exactly. The stop requests report 513 against limit 512 at
`(revision=40,class=2,r=4,d=4,c=0,task=5)`. The live ledger has 40 owners, one
explicit terminal, and 84 uncovered boxes with histogram
`[0,0,0,65,17,2,0]`. Outcomes are 274 no-proposal, 207 duplicate, 14
changed-without-geometric-shrink, and 17 strict-shrink reports. All incomplete,
scheduler-failure, canonical-rejection, refinement, and exact-obstruction
counters remain zero.

The two surviving dimension-five boxes are now frozen exactly in sector chart
coordinates:

```text
lower [0,4,0,0,0,0], upper [inf,inf,0,inf,inf,inf]
lower [2,4,4,0,0,0], upper [inf,inf,inf,0,inf,inf]
```

This ledger concerns only the first bottom-up full-loop-rank sector
representative, mask `[0,0,1,0,1,1]`; it is not a whole-family K6 ledger. Its
complete unchanged degree-zero final-snapshot schedule contains 3,328 tasks.
Consequently the 512 stop is far short of finite-program exhaustion even if no
later owner were admitted. Closing this sector would still leave the other
five nonzero sector orbits and their atomic bottom-up wave publication before
a single K6 artifact could cover all five registered three-loop Vakint graph
classes.

## Audited compact production coordinator

Commit `e873de8` installs the independently audited, topology-neutral
window-one coordinator required by the next measurements. Its public stop
taxonomy separates exact compiler closure, owner-set mutation, actionable
refinement, operational bounds, hard failure, and clean exhaustion of one
declared finite configuration. In particular, `ExhaustedAtConfig` is not a
closure result and cannot be produced from a report cap.

The production seam is compact and transactional:

1. A pure class schedule emits only `(r,d,c,profile)` descriptors and builds a
   plan on demand against the current exact complement.
2. A campaign epoch is keyed by opaque owner-ledger snapshot identity,
   immutable plan identity, a fresh nonce, and its boundary/resource
   configuration. The coordinator structurally owns its semantic adapter,
   exact zero-source incidence, ordered task-relative probe program, and the
   process-local nonce of the concrete ledger to which it was bound. Worker
   count is telemetry, not semantic identity.
3. Workers may evaluate immutable tickets concurrently, but results commit in
   canonical class/task/probe order. Any owner-set mutation discards all later
   results and replans from the new exact revision.
4. The current serial coordinator consumes and drops each task report after
   retaining checked scalar counters. Its live memory is bounded by the exact
   uncovered partition, the class schedule, the largest materialized class
   plan, and one evaluated task. It retains no completed task history. A later
   parallel executor may replace the single-task window with a bounded
   out-of-order window without changing serial commit semantics.
5. Proposal evaluation and serial owner application remain separate. Typed
   stops distinguish `CompilerClosed`, `OwnerSetChanged`, `NeedsRefinement`,
   `Failed`, and `ExhaustedAtConfig`; exhaustion has no closure authority.

Every task receives the same nonempty, coordinator-owned exact probe program.
The coordinator checks that all seven scheduler outcome buckets sum to that
cardinality and that
canonical replay attempts agree with both scheduler replay and replay-engine
telemetry. Any owner mutation ends the immutable epoch immediately; stale
siblings are discarded and the next call replans from the new opaque ledger
identity. Before reporting clean exhaustion it revalidates that identity and
requires an exact `Incomplete(NonFinite)` compiler snapshot with a nonfinite
uncovered region, zero missing terminals, and zero guard-incomplete owners.
The copied snapshot remains telemetry rather than publication authority:
artifact sealing must still consume the live exact ledger.

Commit `b377b10` now preflights every fallible compact-census join and every
possible compiled-owner counter state before serial owner application. The
exact ledger itself stages and validates compilation, partition comparison,
and revision advance before replacing live state; after application the
coordinator only selects one prevalidated scalar state. Adversarial tests
force distinct possible-action counter overflows and prove that both the
exact snapshot and opaque ledger identity remain unchanged.

Commit `16d0cea` closes that production-hardening gate. The adapter constructs
and owns its ordinary zero-source incidence and performs one cold, row-exact
join against the sealed completed source chronology. The coordinator owns the
adapter and fixed task-relative modular probes; it materializes each concrete
sample with checked `task.lattice_target + offset` arithmetic. It is bound to
one concrete ledger nonce and rejects an otherwise identical foreign ledger
before closure or census handling. Caller-authored campaign strings, per-call
probe batches, and arbitrary probe callbacks have been removed. No digest,
repeated hot-path authentication, topology dispatch, or compatibility shim was
introduced. The independently audited 80-report checkpoint and ignored
two-run 256-report checkpoint remain bit-for-bit exact after this migration.

### Extended release-mode observation

A transient release-mode driver subsequently requested at most 16,384 reports
from the same zero-offset-seed, degree-zero program while retaining one
coordinator across every exact ledger mutation. It did not reach that cap or
an unchanged-program exhaustion. At report 10,926, staging the next proposal
returned the typed operational failure

```text
ResourceLimit {
    resource: "staged sector-closure owner canonical content bytes",
    requested: 67,184,181,
    limit: 67,108,864,
}
```

The failed transaction left the exact ledger unchanged at revision 181 with
181 owners, one terminal, and 129 nonfinite boxes. The free-dimension
histogram was `[0,12,77,28,10,2,0]`; an unchanged degree-zero schedule at that
snapshot would still contain 4,000 tasks. The cumulative outcomes were 6,009
no-proposal, 4,745 duplicate, 97 changed-without-geometric-shrink, and 75
strict-shrink reports, with no incomplete proposal or exact obstruction. The
run took 272.39 seconds; its last sampled peak RSS was 184,048 KiB and is only
a lower bound because the process exited before a final sample.

Two dimension-five boxes still survived, now in the canonical decomposition

```text
lower [0,1,0,0,0,0], upper [inf,inf,0,inf,inf,inf]
lower [0,3,4,0,0,0], upper [inf,inf,inf,0,inf,inf]
```

Their smaller finite lower endpoints do not mean that the uncovered union
grew: bounded four-dimensional staircase slabs from the earlier decomposition
can coalesce with an old unbounded tail when the exact complement is
recanonicalized. Every committed mutation first proves
`updated \ baseline = empty`; the failing staging operation occurred before
the only live-state replacement. The transient driver was removed after the
audit rather than retained as another expensive regression.

This observation is neither closure nor a reason to raise the byte limit and
continue blindly. More than ten thousand ordinary-source proposals kept
adding exact local owners while both five-dimensional tails survived. The
offline comparison then identified their first missing action as a generic
affine factorized-numerator route, which RustRed independently derives from
the family and authenticated unimodular factorization basis. That action
language is the next gate; richer source neighborhoods must not be inferred
merely from the operational stop. No oracle rule or coefficient enters
RustRed publication authority.

## Complete-family and factorized-chart follow-up

Vakint's five registered three-loop matcher roots are useful routing and
acceptance fixtures, but they are not a complete denominator-sector manifest.
They cover 34 of the 38 raw full-rank masks. The four omitted masks form the
star orbit represented by `[0,0,1,1,0,1]`, which the installed unimodular
authority proves is a `K1^3` product. Therefore the five roots, the 26 raw
scaleless masks, and that four-mask product orbit account for the complete
64-mask downset without a sixth interacting chart. RustRed still plans from
the maximal K4 root and its eleven authenticated `S4` orbits. Supplying all
five matcher roots as internal ISP-completed charts changes campaign
coordinates and seeds, not the nine ordinary three-loop IBP identities, and
declaring their arbitrary-power classes to be terminals would only rename an
infinite unsolved family.

The production factorization-routing compiler now has a cold, non-owning
endpoint expansion boundary. It uses Symbolica's native exact sparse
polynomial power, not a RustRed multinomial CAS, and returns deterministic,
exactly coalesced `(IntegralKey, Coefficient)` endpoints. The two surviving
path representatives expand to 28 and 210 raw endpoints. Exact recurrence
replay, K3-times-K1 coverage, large-rank width-one behavior, power-shift
underflow, retained endpoint bytes, aggregate symmetry-orbit work, strict
coefficient policy, and route capability identity are regression-pinned. The
boundary currently admits only parameter-independent affine coefficients;
parameter-dependent coefficient powers are rejected before native expansion
until their coefficient-term work has its own exact admission proof. It
remains deliberately incapable of producing an artifact owner.

A separately audited next experiment avoids feeding those endpoints back into
the parent reducer. Both three-line path and star charts are authenticated
products of three one-loop radial blocks. Sequential isotropic integration of
those blocks can retain radial powers and reduce the complete scalar
dot/numerator sector to the one installed `K1^3` master. Likewise, the
`K3 x K1` chart can peel only the independent one-loop block and pass the
resulting scalar polynomial to the immutable K3 and K1 reducers, producing at
most the two existing parent-master embeddings. Since no parent-family key is
re-entered, this design has no star-routing cycle.

The old bounded corner oracle is not this owner. Its `q_i^2 = 1` replacement
is valid only for undotted tadpole corners. For example, with `D=q^2-1`, exact
one-loop reduction gives `integral(q^2/D^2) = (d/2) integral(1/D)`, whereas the
corner shortcut gives `((d-2)/2) integral(1/D)`. The prototype must therefore
retain every radial power, use the lower artifacts for its exact reduction,
and carry an indexed generic-dimension guard `d+R-2 != 0` at even angular rank
`R`.

Before any ownership claim, the prototype must also:

- use the original installer-authenticated factor block map, or reauthenticate
  a selected signed routing gauge against the dependency coordinates;
- compile its domain as the exact preimage of every dependency root box,
  including radial-shift headroom and checked `i64` endpoints;
- use iterative, explicitly bounded angular dynamic programming and Symbolica
  exact integers/polynomials for multiplicities and affine expansion;
- support only products whose factors are all one-loop radial blocks except
  for at most one correlated multi-loop block; and
- return a typed unsupported disposition for cross-coupled products of two or
  more correlated multi-loop blocks, which belong to the deferred tensor
  project.

Passing this experiment will close the factorized bottom wave, not the whole
K6 family. Four-, five-, and six-line irreducible waves must still close under
ordinary/translated source discovery with the new immutable lower feedback,
and artifact publication still requires zero uncovered branches everywhere.

## Historical product-moment prototype result (removed)

This section preserves measurements from a prototype that has since been
deleted from the active engine. It is historical research evidence only. The
current code retains the bounded non-owning multi-affine expansion primitive,
not the product-moment compiler, owner, or evaluator described below.

The bounded `K1^N` prototype described above was executable for the path and
star `K1^3` charts. It was deliberately schema-free and non-owning. Its
compiler binds the installed terminal authority, factorization rule, signed
singleton loop rows, exact parent slots, three sealed one-loop dependencies,
normalization, raw master embedding, and process-local capability. Evaluation
uses Symbolica's native exact sparse polynomial power for routed numerator and
`(D+1)^r` expansion, an iterative explicitly bounded angular incidence DP,
and the ordinary one-loop `Reducer` for every radial shift. A public Symbolica
isotropic-moment primitive was checked for and was not present; only that
domain-specific recurrence is implemented locally.

The focused acceptance suite proves:

- numerator-free path and star corners terminate in the installed product
  terminal with the installed normalization;
- `q^2/D^2` gives `(d/2) T` through the sealed one-loop artifact, rather than
  the obsolete undotted-corner shortcut;
- odd incidence vanishes, the rank-two coefficient is `1/d`, and the
  rank-four coefficient is `3/(d(d+2))`, with the traversed `d` and `d+2`
  guards retained even when later algebra cancels a factor;
- the known path and star numerator samples reproduce
  `2(d+2)^2/d^2` and `(d^2-8)/d^2` exactly; and
- the two persistent path witnesses `[-2,-6,1,-2,3,3]` and
  `[-4,-6,7,0,3,3]` reduce deterministically to one authenticated terminal,
  after 3,886 and 4,396 exact scalar monomials respectively, with their full
  angular guard provenance and no unresolved leaves.

The prototype exposes caller limits for native support, operation, exponent,
angular-state, transition, pending, radial, dependency-request, coefficient,
key, guard, and coalescing work. The compiler now admits exactly one correlated
closed block accompanied by at least one independent one-loop block. For
`K3 x K1`, partial isotropic elimination integrates only the singleton vector,
preserves the complete K3 Gram polynomial with its authenticated row signs,
and reduces the resulting keys through the sealed K3 and K1 artifacts. Exact
tests pin the scalar corner, both active dots, routed numerator sources, odd
zero, rank-two and rank-four moments, signed mixed products, and both installed
parent-master embeddings. Products with two correlated blocks still return a
typed unsupported result. This result does not yet compile an infinite-domain
owner or close the rank-three wave, so it is not a K6 artifact or Vakint
three-loop parity claim.

The follow-up interpretation of Vakint's matcher roots is recorded in
[the sector-local coordinate-chart proposal](sector_local_coordinate_chart_2026.md).
A bounded executable fixture now derives all five roots inside the one complete
K6 contraction plan and builds deterministic foreign ISP-completed charts.
They seed 34 raw full-rank masks across five `S4` orbits; the four-member star
orbit `[0,0,1,1,0,1]` remains unseeded by a matcher but is structurally owned
as a `K1^3` product. With the 26 zero masks, those two mechanisms cover every
physical sector. The S5 completion appends `s23` and
replays `2 s23 = 1 + D2 + D3 - D6` exactly. This proves chart feasibility and
authority separation, not improved source coverage. Natural S4/S5 ISP charts
may nominate sparse correlated parent source portfolios, but every nomination
