# Four-loop H closure probe

This report records the first release attempt to turn the generic RustRed
source-port solver into a durable four-loop artifact. The family was supplied
as ordinary data (the first nine physical H propagators plus the auxiliary ISP
`D10` at power zero); no topology name is consulted by the solver.

**Setup correction:** this original example helper retained symbolic common
mass `m`, despite its unit-mass name. It has since been corrected to literal
mass squared one, as used by the external TOML input and required by the
artifact installer. The counts below describe only the first rejected sector,
not a family-wide closure tally. See the
[ordering follow-up](four_loop_ordering_probe.md) for subsequent runs.

```

The run classified all ten-index sectors with Symbolica's unrestricted zero
analyzer, shared the ordinary source system across six workers, and attempted
`SourcePortAudit::install_complete`. Publication correctly failed closed:

```text
sector [false, false, false, false, false, true, true, false, true, true]
60/63 replayed, 60/63 descending, 7 uncovered boxes
rule 41 stored guard geometry: non-coordinate exceptional ownership remains unsupported
rule 42 stored guard geometry: coupled affine ownership is not yet supported by the artifact bridge
rule 48 stored guard geometry: coupled affine ownership is not yet supported by the artifact bridge
```

This is not evidence that the IBP search itself is complete, nor is it an
artifact. It identifies the next generic implementation requirement: preserve
the affine exceptional cases produced by discovery, compile their integer
charts/ownership into the artifact verifier, and only then retry all sectors.
The core must remain family- and topology-neutral; the H constructor is merely
an example input while `examples/input/four_loop_h.toml` is the canonical
user-supplied representation.

The artifact bridge now reports these failures as typed
`UnsupportedAffineOwnership` diagnostics. Each diagnostic retains the sector,
the fixed-coordinate face, the exact coupled equations, and whether the
unsupported domain is a target or an exceptional branch. This is deliberately
diagnostic only: rectangular hulls and sampled affine points are not accepted
as coverage proofs, so publication remains fail-closed until an affine-aware
application-domain carrier and integer-lattice coverage proof are implemented.
