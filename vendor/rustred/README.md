# RustRed

The [Feynkit bridge](crates/rustred-feynkit/README.md) adds native parametric
and Laporta IBP solving to `symbolica.community.hepkit`, including multiscale
two-loop graph tests and a [FeynCalc phi4 reproduction notebook](examples/notebooks/feyncalc_phi4_two_loop.ipynb).

The [WebAssembly/Pyodide build](docs/wasm.md) uses Symbolica's portable
arithmetic backend and supports serial IBP generation, artifact inspection,
certification and reduction through RustRed's Python and HEPKit APIs. Browser
sessions execute synchronously; native builds retain their existing background
coordinator and multicore execution.

RustRed is a pre-alpha, pure-Rust and Symbolica-native project for deriving and
applying parametric integration-by-parts identities. Its active target is
finite, power-counted five-loop single-scale vacuum starting domains, building on the completed
four-loop FORM-less Vakint numerical comparisons against FMFT.
The four-loop numerical acceptance gate passes; unrestricted closure certification
remains separate from the shipped candidate programs.
The active generic solver treats loop count and topology as input data, not
dispatch keys.

The current optimization build adds [persisted runtime integral orders](docs/runtime_integral_order.md)
and [parallel Epoch preparation/publication](docs/epoch_s5.md). Source-row
visitation and mathematical integral ordering are separate runtime controls;
changing a rule's mathematical order requires regenerating that owner, not
recompiling the engine. Native and Python correctness gates pass. Matched
[measurements](docs/research/final_order_s5_pilots_2026-09-30.md) show 40–44%
less four-loop domain work with source-aware rule selection, with faster total
runs in both pairs. Two small five-loop controls with different generation
policies also improve, but do not cover the full production request. Fixed-cut
S5 runtime is neutral, while checkpoints are56–61% smaller; current rolling
controls are slower than Ready, so Epoch deployment remains unqualified. See
[the current progress log](CODEX_PROGRESS.md) for deployment status; the dated
development results below are not instructions to replace a running campaign.

Uniform Symbolica-native binary I/O and the exact unit-weight terminal
normalization gate are complete. Bounded five-loop candidate studies have
resumed with the explicit goal of covering renormalizable starting inputs,
with correlated numerator and denominator-power bounds. This supersedes the
earlier demand for R10 with arbitrary positive powers; saved R10 programs and
controls remain useful foundations. See [the current input contract](docs/finite_starting_domains.md)
for the physical assumptions and the distinction between marginal coefficients
and a full UV Taylor jet. Terminal minimization, numerical master lookup
and five-loop Vakint integration follow only after that coverage succeeds. The recorded
[full-family attempts](docs/research/five_loop_candidate_baselines.md) reach
time or memory limits; checkpoints preserve partial work, but complete
coverage of the frozen five-loop census is not yet established. The existing rule-application engine
remains in use; no alternate Symbolica-replacement backend is planned.

Candidate generation accepts an optional `--max-numerator-rank R`, also exposed
as `max_numerator_rank` in the Rust request and `import rustred` Python API.
It bounds the **sum of negative index powers** of starting integrals, not
positive denominator powers or intermediate dependencies. Nonlinear exceptions
can be refined into exhaustive bounded numerator slices while retaining
symbolic denominator powers. Rank-scoped candidates are explicitly experimental,
not certified closed artifacts; see [the scope and workflow](docs/rank_scoped_generation.md).
The experimental `--finite-case-policy retain-rank-finite` option keeps finite
rank-bounded leaves without trying to minimize their count. It requires an
explicit R, never truncates positive rays, and reports exhausted work limits
as incomplete. Its release regressions pass; complete five-loop coverage
remains an open goal.

The latest [five-loop checks](docs/rank_scoped_generation.md#completing-and-applying-that-six-sector-downset)
generate a complete selected six-sector candidate bundle and exactly reduce
two rank-10 inputs to declared terminals, with memoized equality and no uncovered
dependencies. These finite checks are not all-family or arbitrary-positive-power
closure. A separate native Symbolica Gröbner-ordering correction completes a
previously stalled search-policy sector in 57.4 seconds; the complete core and
application regression gates pass. All topologies remain external inputs.

All 67 five-loop graph classes now have saved candidate programs. The experimental
`load_generated_candidate_owners` and `RoutedCandidateReducer` share them across
verified equivalent routings, including affine numerator expansion and pinches.
Missing owners and missing rules remain distinct outcomes; saved local programs
are not yet a recursively complete R10 family solve. The
[shared five-loop campaign plan](docs/five_loop_rank_campaign.md) now targets the
finite physical envelope within 15 hours on at most 50 cores and 500 GB,
when measurements support a credible attempt. Certification is deferred and
there is no inherited 30-minute deadline.

The [shared-owner campaign driver](docs/shared_owner_campaign_driver.md) exposes
`rustred routed-campaign`, the Rust `routed_campaign_with_progress` service and
`examples/python/shared_owner_campaign.py`. Concrete targets share one parallel
dependency queue, immutable programs and duplicate-work suppression. Live TTY
and structured non-TTY monitoring report progress, resources and the first
failure during native-call drain. Concrete-target mode does not persist its
queue or claim parametric closure from a finite trace. Directed Rust owner searches can
publish immutable partial-domain rule overlays without copying the saved
library; see [the API boundary](docs/shared_owner_campaign_driver.md#directed-owner-search-and-shared-rule-installation).

The symbolic saved-owner walk has a separate
[manual production launcher](examples/python/production_saved_owner_campaign.py),
native checkpoint/resume, Ctrl-C save-and-stop, hourly automatic saves and a
configurable RAM guard (default: save and stop at 475 GB of a 500 GB ceiling).
Its colored TTY/read-only monitor and persistent non-TTY receipts distinguish
actual CPU use from reserved workers and completed entry obligations from the
still-growing descendant worklist. See the
[Nix/build/launch/resume instructions](docs/shared_owner_campaign_driver.md#running)
and [launch-readiness record](docs/research/manual_five_loop_campaign_2026-09-24.md).
Do not launch a duplicate of the user's production campaign. Its current
identity, protected resources and status are recorded in
[CODEX_PROGRESS.md](CODEX_PROGRESS.md); historical restart commands are not
current launch instructions. Neither completion nor a full-family ETA is
claimed. The earlier [four-loop control and five-loop restart](docs/research/five_loop_coarse_cover_restart_2026-09-24.md)
remain historical evidence.

An experimental [ready-ticket publication policy](docs/research/five_loop_ready_publication_2026-09-24.md)
is being validated to remove same-owner head-of-line waiting while preserving
shared admission and resumable per-source progress. Ordered remains the default;
the live campaign is unchanged. A larger active-worker count alone is not a
completed-workload speedup or a five-loop completion claim.

The preceding local-matcher release gate passed **2,588 core tests** and **296
application/integration tests**; the shared-campaign and domain-query Python
steering tests passed **16 tests**. The preceding matched finite
rank-one controls complete in 20.437/8.067 seconds of traversal with one/six
workers (126.11/112.08 seconds including preparation), with identical reported
graph counters and zero missing rules. The latest 50-worker R10 diagnostic gets
past the earlier expansion-budget failure, but is cooperatively stopped for
optimization after 854.064 seconds of traversal: 42.7 million queued nodes and
25.47 GB peak RSS. This is not a timeout or completed reduction.
[The profile and next improvements](docs/research/shared_rank10_pressure_2026-09-21.md)
target expensive routing, native powering and limited effective parallelism.
No full five-loop R10 completion is claimed.

The delivered slices batch shared work publication, combine duplicate-work
indexes, tighten structural expansion bounds and expose explicit per-call
budgets. Dependency tracing now visits Symbolica's exact coalesced numerator
support without constructing coefficient wrappers it would discard. This
preserves the coefficient-returning reducer, endpoint ordering and per-call
budget behavior; the matched controls above include this visitor.
An opt-in Rust [`RoutedFeedbackSession`](docs/owner_source_feedback.md)
retains source-generated parametric rules between rounds; automatic CLI feedback
and durable graph resume remain unfinished. New performance measurements must
be reported separately from the preceding corrected-run timings.

The new [`owner-domain-scan`](docs/owner_domain_scan.md) Rust/CLI service and
Python example stream the saved rules' possible successor domains without
enumerating positive powers. It retains actual intermediate-rank requirements
and native guard predicates. This conservative one-hop inventory is not yet
the full-domain feedback worklist: finishing a scan does not establish closure
or identify every reported edge as a genuine missing rule. The same release
gate includes sharded duplicate preprobes, with ordered global budget admission.
Their matched traversal times are **20.978 / 7.153 seconds** with one/six workers;
all 18 reported counters match. Six-worker tracing improves modestly, but serial
tracing and total command time do not. These are individual shared-host
observations, not evidence of full R10 closure or fifty-worker scaling.
The domain-scan Python steering adds two passing tests. Its live completion
summary is compact even when the separately saved result is large; explicit
reporting allowances can be raised without changing the mathematical rank scope.
The [complete stored-rule inventory](docs/research/shared_owner_domain_inventory_2026-09-21.md)
scans all 67 owners in 11.009 seconds after preparation (123.13 seconds whole
command, about 6.45 GB peak RSS), retaining 4.76 million potential successor
regions. This is not yet recursive rank-ten closure.

[`owner-domain-match`](docs/shared_owner_domain_matching.md) and
`examples/python/match_shared_owner_domains.py` then classify explicitly supplied
symbolic index boxes against the saved rules' actual priority and native guards.
Positive powers can stay unbounded, and successor rank is not clipped to the
saved entry rank. The result distinguishes selected rules, terminals, genuine
local gaps, invalid source conditions and unresolved geometry. This reuses saved
programs; it does not regenerate IBPs or claim recursive closure. A local gap in
a conservative successor box still needs its predecessor conditions checked
before being treated as an actually reached missing-rule frontier.
The [first real five-loop query study](docs/research/shared_owner_domain_matching_2026-09-21.md)
finds applicable existing rules for all three examined rank-11 child boxes.
Ten exact finite-numerator slices resolve one remaining source-guard ambiguity
without bounding positive powers or generating new IBPs. The full R10 campaign
is still unfinished; these are selected local examples, not closure timings.

The implementation includes opt-in `--max-bounded-refinement-cells-per-query`
to perform those finite inactive-coordinate splits automatically. Add
`--bounded-refinement-axes finite-axes` to also use explicitly bounded positive
coordinates; unbounded powers remain symbolic. This refinement option alone
does not change routing or establish recursive closure. With
`--follow-successors`, it also inspects selected RHSs and shares containing
owner/box/rank domains through one worklist. Conditional coefficients and
unresolved routing remain explicit; neither queue exhaustion nor a local match
alone is presented as full closure. Add `--route-domain-overcover` to share
conservative domain images through already admitted momentum
maps, without expanding numerator polynomials. These images now preserve mapped
finite positive-power bounds and account for the numerator degree consumed by
each pinch. Bounds also survive IBP-successor routing and reentry; original
entry restrictions are never reapplied to descendants. Unchecked source conditions or
missing maps remain explicit obligations. Native algebra preflight refusals can
use the same bounded inactive-coordinate refinement as unresolved guards;
actual backend errors cannot. The same Python steering accepts these
options and the native `--max-guard-univariate-degree` work allowance. No saved
IBPs are regenerated for these domain queries. See the
[interface and limits](docs/shared_owner_domain_matching.md).
Full five-loop coverage is **not yet established**. An earlier same-input
[67-owner local control](docs/research/guard_obstruction_triage_2026-09-22.md)
resolves 60 owners and retains 81 unresolved guard regions, with no exact gaps
or native-work refusal. Local matching takes 94.09 s (206.50 s whole command);
this is not a complete recursive solve or IBP-generation timing. The guard
shortcuts pass 2,661 core, 323 application and 19 Python tests, with zero failures
and 32 existing ignored core diagnostics.

The separate [shared-traversal controls](docs/research/shared_domain_index_2026-09-22.md)
reuse saved programs across owners, reaching 3,886 completed domains before an
optional RHS numerator-classification preflight refusal. Recursive work remains
queued. The new slice retains conditional successors for eligible optional
refusals while keeping denominator/source validity strict. Bounded first-per-phase
diagnostics are separate from missing-rule frontiers. The new all67 shared
control inspects 702,384 successors with 702,253 request reuses in 31.35 s of
traversal, but stops at its RHS-cell work allowance before finishing its first
domain. This is not complete R10 coverage. Bounded parallel symbolic inspection,
coherent per-query/aggregate work allowances and tighter `R-k` bounds after
routed pinches are now implemented and independently audited. Their release
suites pass **2,663 core / 341 application / 22 Python tests**, with zero
failures (32 existing core diagnostics ignored). The public
`examples/python/shared_owner_campaign.py --queries ...` supervisor provides
the same 50-core/500 GB ceiling and no elapsed solve deadline for symbolic work.
Both full-census controls are incomplete: serial stopped at its containment-work
allowance, while six workers were stopped for optimization after measured
ordered-publication waiting. There is no matched completed-workload
parallel speedup for this slice yet. See
[the implementation report](docs/research/parallel_symbolic_domains_2026-09-22.md).
No saved IBPs are regenerated merely to repeat these application diagnostics.

The subsequent saved guarded-case core passes **2,684 release tests**, with
zero failures and 32 existing ignored diagnostics. It applies native affine
cases while retaining whole guards and exact successor images. Its application
and bounded job-local reuse changes pass **362 Rust application/integration
tests and 26 Python tests**. The new
[`owner-guarded-apply` diagnostic](docs/guarded_owner_rule_diagnostics.md)
and Python steering expose saved-rule conditions without regenerating IBPs.
Both actual diagonal controls are rejected by later necessary exclusions before
RHS application; successful diagnostic exit does not mean successful reduction.
The reuse-only retry still used about one busy core out of six. The subsequent
initial-domain sharing and larger bounded worker buffers pass **377 application/
integration tests and 27 Python tests**. General containment comparisons are now
unlimited by default; finite diagnostic budgets remain optional. The next full
campaign uses **50 workers, 500 GB**, not six, and is now launched. The corrected
optional guard lookahead passes **2,700 core tests**; the real all-67 check
finishes without native errors and retains **57 unresolved regions rather than
81**. Required guards remain strict. These are incomplete application
diagnostics, not full R10 closure. See [the milestone](docs/research/guarded_owner_application_2026-09-22.md)
and [current scheduling results](docs/research/parallel_symbolic_domains_2026-09-22.md).

An opt-in [independent starting-topology campaign](docs/independent_owner_campaigns.md)
adds a dynamic outer queue while preserving the native scheduler within each
job (for example, 10 jobs × 5 workers). Rust owns the colored monitor, aggregate
RAM protection, checkpoints and one compact combined rule selection. The
default shared campaign remains available. Joint source-support mask pruning
is a separate opt-in switch; neither switch regenerates saved IBPs or by
itself establishes five-loop closure.
Read the [measured comparison](docs/research/joint_pruning_independent_campaigns_2026-09-25.md)
before restarting: isolating owners can lose the shared auxiliary coverage
that makes a symbolic campaign finish, despite raising CPU occupancy.
The limited all-67-owner control reached about 50 busy cores with 50 one-core
slots, but completed in 296.1 seconds versus 153.4 seconds shared; repeated
preparation and extra descendant work outweighed the utilization gain. Joint
pruning also remains off by default: its measured rank-two pilot saved local
work without an end-to-end speedup. Neither result recommends replacing the
current production campaign.

For a future fresh attempt, the production launcher can now copy an existing
campaign's immutable inputs with `--prepare-from`, placing its existing broad
helpers before narrower queries without changing their bounds. A completed
four-loop FG control improved from 18.53 s to 16.44 s; five-loop benefit remains
unmeasured. See the [fresh preparation and launch recipe](docs/shared_owner_campaign_driver.md#recommended-fresh-attempt-existing-helpers-first).
This does not reorder, restart or alter a running campaign or its checkpoints.

The shared-walker monitor now distinguishes **recursively closed starting
domains** (the progress bar) from initial publication, and reports total
discovered/closed/unresolved domains. Tracking is native and checkpointed;
old runs without the dependency history display unknown closure. New CP5
campaigns start fresh from the same saved rules, without IBP regeneration.
See the [monitoring and clean restart recipe](docs/shared_owner_campaign_driver.md#dependency-closure-monitoring-fresh-campaign-format).

Long candidate-generation campaigns can opt into native per-sector checkpoints
using `family-candidates --checkpoint-dir TMP/my-campaign`, then `--resume` after
interruption. Rust and Python expose the same controls. This saves completed
work without changing any IBP algorithm or claiming closure; see the
[checkpoint workflow and resource boundaries](docs/CLI.md#save-candidates-certify-independently).
For a complete checkpoint directory, the Rust application API also offers
`load_generated_candidate_checkpoint`: load the saved sectors into one shared
experimental reducer without regenerating rules or assembling a monolithic
bundle. It requires the matching generation request and explicit resume;
missing sectors are errors. See [checkpoint application](docs/rank_scoped_generation.md#applying-a-complete-checkpoint-directory).
For isolated Rust-library experiments, `encode_generated_candidate_sector`
saves an already-returned `SectorSolution` in the same native candidate format,
without another solve or any checkpoint mutation. A one-sector export remains
partial: absent successor sectors are uncovered, not inferred terminals. See
[saving an isolated sector](docs/rank_scoped_generation.md#saving-an-isolated-sector).

To inspect saved candidate rules without generating them again, use
`rustred candidate-inspect --input rules.rrbin --output rules.json`, or
`rustred.inspect_candidate_program(bundle_bytes)` in Python. The Rust function is
`rustred_app::inspect_generated_candidate_program`. These diagnostic views expose
ordered cases, guards, shifts and exact terminal keys in original family
coordinates. They are not a new persistence format or a closure certificate;
see [candidate inspection](docs/CLI.md#inspect-saved-candidate-programs).

For interactive Python clients, `rustred.start_family_candidates(...)` returns
a native session with bounded structured events, retained progress snapshots,
GIL-releasing waits and cooperative cancellation. `session.result().artifact()`
provides paginated sector/rule/terminal views; selected coefficient polynomials
are decoded and cached only on demand. HEPKit can use the same implementation
through the optional `rustred-feynkit/campaign-api` feature and its existing
native `IBPFamily`, sharing the host's Symbolica kernel rather than importing a
second extension. See the [session API and lifecycle limits](crates/rustred-python/README.md#in-process-streamed-generation-and-lazy-exploration).
Generated candidates and finite residual lists are not closure certificates.

For saved owner campaigns, [`walk-inventory`](docs/scalar_rank_campaign.md#inspect-rules-terminals-and-normalized-candidate-masters)
reports installed rules, rules and terminals encountered in the saved domain
cover, and optional exact terminal normalization. It is read-only and uses
cold reinspection; normalized representatives are candidate masters, not a
proven minimal basis.

Saved campaigns automatically publish a portable symbolic package after
successful scoped coverage collection. Master refinement is **manual**, never
an implicit consequence of running or extending the campaign. The
[saved-campaign interface](docs/campaign_master_reduction.md) takes the campaign
directory, so no hash-named artifact path needs to be copied:

```bash
python -B examples/python/saved_campaign.py run --campaign "$CAMPAIGN"
python -B examples/python/saved_campaign.py inspect --campaign "$CAMPAIGN"
python -B examples/python/saved_campaign.py extend --campaign "$CAMPAIGN" --rank 1
# Optional, only when wanted:
python -B examples/python/saved_campaign.py refine --campaign "$CAMPAIGN" --seed-depth 0
```

Inspection uses an aligned coloured table on a terminal, or JSON in a pipeline;
it distinguishes published bounds from newly requested bounds. Refinement is
a finite exact Laporta-style search with its own interruption/resume checkpoint.
The last published package remains inspectable while an extension or refinement
is unfinished. Remaining masters are a nonminimal candidate basis, not numerical
values. These packages preserve native programs, routing and terminal relations
for later Vakint integration; the saved-campaign engine does not yet provide
general coefficient back-substitution through its dependency traces.

Explicit `refine` also collects compatible scalar/dotted unit-mass vacuum
terminals using exact full-U aliases and native diagonal ordinary IBPs. This
runs in Rust automatically after the finite search; numerator-bearing and
unsupported keys are retained. To collect across separately published families,
repeat `--collection-artifact /path/to/peer-package`. The result owns its native
member sessions and composed application maps, so it does not depend on those
peer paths afterwards. Inspection distinguishes the primary campaign from the
combined collection; fewer terminal labels imply neither new coverage nor a
minimal master basis. See [collection and application](docs/campaign_master_reduction.md#native-terminal-collection-and-application).

New explicit refinements also combine the retained finite rowspaces, including
unresolved auxiliary integrals, to expose additional exact cancellations. This
finite feedback adds no source seeds and does not run during `extend` or ordinary
publication; those operations retain its already proved substitutions. Use
`refine --no-finite-feedback` to disable new feedback discovery. On the frozen
five-loop inventory it reduces 607 candidate masters to 601, with a one-off
refinement cost of 34.76 s versus 21.39 s; the four-loop combined count stays 20.
See the [measured impact and limitations](docs/research/finite_refinement_feedback_2026-10-08.md).

Generated candidate programs now use a shared Symbolica-native binary
coefficient dictionary and native family geometry, rather than coefficient
strings in TOML. The original family input remains provenance, not a loading
requirement. Timing reports and user input remain human-readable TOML.
The new Rust loader is `load_generated_candidate_bundle`; load only trusted
generated programs because Symbolica's native readers are not hostile-input
parsers. This format change does not certify candidates or change rule
application. Four-loop data migration and the corresponding certified-artifact
format migration are tracked in the [binary I/O plan](docs/research/native_binary_io_plan.md).
Certified artifacts use the same native container with a distinct certified
kind and V6 proof records. Loading still independently replays sources, guards,
descent and coverage before admitting the owner. Equal mathematical programs
need not have identical file bytes when Symbolica's prior process state differs;
the comparison checks structure, every exact coefficient and its variable map.
The [measured candidate migration](docs/research/native_binary_io_results_2026-09-19.md)
preserves all 59,636 saved four-loop rules: compressed size falls from 29.95 MB
to 20.51 MB, and H/X cold-loader diagnostics improve by about 21×. This is not
an IBP-generation or first-reduction speedup. Vakint milestone `b6b02a636`
ships these native programs and passes all 15 numerical references, all 16
expanded-numerator/pinch comparisons and 54 paired public scalar benchmark
comparisons. The same nine-input benchmark uses 2.73 GiB peak RSS instead of
14.0 GiB; these are shared-host diagnostics, not a controlled speedup claim.
Vakint `39992f757` also ships the migrated certified V6 K1/K3/K6 assets, with
the 83-test through-three-loop selection and all 31 four-loop comparisons
passing on RustRed `d6718733`. This completes IBP-program transport migration.
The remaining offline terminal-value catalogs now have a generic native
Atom/State codec: all 1,155 values are preserved exactly in 30,307 bytes instead
of 83,020. Vakint `909164121` pins RustRed `d51721b6` and passes the same
83 lower-loop checks and all 31 four-loop comparisons, completing this I/O gate; see
[the catalog migration](docs/research/native_terminal_catalog.md).
Separately, [opt-in exact terminal normalization](docs/research/terminal_normalization.md)
now proves 650 routing/product aliases and reduces the four-family output-key
census from 1,155 to 505, without regenerating rules. The product-only baseline
found 237 aliases; the extension verifies full-rank supports with one linear
dependence among their active momenta. All 650 equalities pass independent exact
catalog checks. Vakint `8e91d32f` enables this plan once per loaded four-loop
program, pins RustRed `f91c47ab`, and passes all 83 lower-loop checks and 31
four-loop comparisons. The matched nine-input public benchmark passes all 54
numerical comparisons; whole-harness wall time decreases from 164.83 to 96.35 s
and peak RSS from 2.73 to 2.12 GiB. These totals include both RustRed and FMFT,
not just RustRed reduction. First-use cubed-parent calls remain slower than
FMFT, whereas warm calls are faster on this matrix. See
[the measured rollout](docs/research/terminal_normalization.md#vakint-routing-alias-rollout)
for boundaries and caveats. This does not assert a minimal master basis.

The next opt-in [parameter-equivalence lane](docs/research/vacuum_parametric_terminal_equivalence.md)
compares complete vacuum `U` polynomials under power-preserving parameter
permutations, using native Symbolica graph canonicalization and exact replay.
It reduces the same 1,155 keys to **179 family-local representatives**; all 976
equalities pass independent exact catalog checks. Preparation takes 53–178 ms
per family in the recorded release run, excluding loading. The 105
numerator-bearing keys are retained unchanged. Vakint `71e01122b` now enables
this lane, pinning RustRed `2b50267c`, and passes the same 83 lower-loop checks,
31 four-loop comparisons and 54 benchmark comparisons. In a fresh matched
routing-versus-parameter comparison, first H/X cubed-parent calls improve from
7.18/31.27 s to 6.26/29.45 s; this is a modest incremental gain over routing,
not the larger raw-versus-normalized core speedup. The
[public benchmark](docs/research/vacuum_parametric_terminal_equivalence.md#vakint-activation-and-matched-public-benchmark)
keeps first use, cached calls and FMFT comparisons distinct.

The same candidate applier also offers an explicit Rust-library
`CandidateCacheRepresentation::Factorized` option using Symbolica's native
factorized denominators. In three paired saved-program measurements, median
first H/X cubed-parent applications take 3.86/21.01 s versus 4.40/24.44 s with
ordinary coefficients. Retained memory and cache-hit materialization costs
increase, so ordinary storage remains the default and Vakint is unchanged.
See the [implementation and exact comparisons](docs/research/factorized_coefficients.md#persistent-cache-implemented-and-measured).
These core-application measurements are distinct from the completed
[three-mode generation matrix](docs/four_loop_generation_comparison.md#complete-three-mode-solver-time-matrix-2026-09-19),
which now includes all four parents at one and six workers without a C++ timeout.

The solver implementation follows the
[executable SpIRed reference port](docs/spired_port.md): reproduce the actual
C++ `solveSector` algorithm in Rust, using native Symbolica/numerica, and match
or improve the supplied one-through-three-loop PM example workloads. The
[artifact-to-Vakint delivery lane](docs/spired_vakint_artifact_plan.md) runs in
parallel, extending FeynKit tensor reduction and RustRed scalar reduction to
four loops. The
[Gregor/SpIReD input plan](GREGOR_INPUT_PLAN.md) retains the wider roadmap.
The local reference source and working notes
`notes-spired.pdf` are ignored and are not distributed with the repository.

## Symbolica 3.0 development checkout

The workspace is pinned to Symbolica `3.0.0` and, by default, resolves the
crate from the vendored `vendor/symbolica/` checkout through the
`[patch.crates-io]` entries in the root `Cargo.toml`.  `vendor/symbolica` is a
git submodule containing Symbolica and its graphica/numerica crates. Initialize
it in a fresh checkout before building; no separate `cargo install symbolica`
is needed:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive vendor/symbolica
export SYMBOLICA_LICENSE="<your Symbolica 3 license>"
cargo fetch --locked
cargo check --workspace --locked --offline
cargo build --release --locked --offline
```

The local checkout needs the usual native GMP/MPFR development prerequisites.
The submodule pins unmodified upstream Symbolica `dev` (`ef0db494`, which
contains the multithreaded polynomial-context fix `939c4de8` and the `heap_pow`
overflow fix `7b31114c`); no local Symbolica patch is applied. Native `.rrbin`
artifacts written by older RustRed builds (Symbolica export format 5) are
rejected with an error naming the header converter
`examples/python/convert_native_v5_to_v6.py`.

To use Git dependencies instead, select one compatible revision for all three
`[patch.crates-io]` entries: `symbolica`, `numerica`, and `graphica`. Leave
versions and features unchanged.

Then refresh the dependency source entries in the lockfile and build:

```bash
cargo update -p symbolica -p graphica -p numerica
cargo build --release --locked
```

Keep the three crates on one revision; mixing a Symbolica 2 checkout with the
3.0 `graphica`/`numerica` pair is unsupported.  The rebased GammaLoop
`vakint_rustred` branch uses this same Symbolica 3.0 revision and pins RustRed
to a published commit, while local development may temporarily replace that
git dependency with a workspace path.

## Finite starting-domain planning

`entry-domain-plan` counts a finite scalar-index input envelope and optionally
previews targets. It does **not** generate IBPs or claim closure. Both total
positive denominator power and scalar numerator rank are bounded, with optional
correlations. The separate fixed-target feedback API preserves all integer
indices and reuses existing rules before searching genuine misses.

```sh
rustred entry-domain-plan --input examples/cli/finite_entry_domain.json --output -
python examples/python/plan_finite_entry_domain.py --loops 1 --sectors 1
```

The example has exactly three starting targets: `[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`.
The Python example uses `import rustred`; `--cli /path/to/release/rustred`
selects the equivalent CLI adapter. `--owner-selection SELECTION.json` reads
sector masks from an existing census instead of an observable-specific list.

The named `renormalizable_marginal_feynman` profile is conditional on its stated
Feynman-gauge, forest, scalarization and mass-grading assumptions. It is not
automatic authentication of an arbitrary physical calculation. At five loops
it supplies `A<=24`, `R<=14`, `A-R>=10`; a preview is never exhaustive coverage.
Input bounds never clip IBP descendants. See
[the finite-domain plan and derivation](docs/finite_starting_domains.md).

Two saved-rule five-loop controls have completed dependency tracing: one input
per owner (67 inputs) in 4.26 s, and a 50-input diagonal stress control in
1,552.88 s with 50 configured workers and 26.11 GB sampled peak RSS. The latter
reaches five existing declared terminal keys without missing rules. These are
trace-only timings, not coefficient reductions or complete-family coverage;
cold setup/process time is reported separately in the linked plan. Finite-axis
guard refinement also resolves all 57 previously ambiguous local R10 query
boxes after conservative A24 bounding, in 2.70 s of matching. This removes
those local guard unknowns, not the remaining recursive campaign obligations.

## Current capability

The [September 17 status report](STATUS_17_09_2026.md) and
[checkpoint ledger](docs/checkpoints/2026-09-17.md) record the
historical reconstruction, C++ comparison, certification and experimental Vakint
results. Four-loop candidate generation is usable; unrestricted four-loop
certification remains unfinished. The public Vakint RustRed backend now passes
all 15 existing four-loop numerical-reference cases and 16 additional expanded
propagator-numerator/pinch comparisons against FMFT. The native FeynKit tensor
prepass and RustRed scalar tail use an invalid FORM path; the separate FMFT
oracle uses FORM. These finite tests do not prove arbitrary-index closure.
The [September 19 update](docs/checkpoints/2026-09-19.md) records saved H/FG/BMW/X
programs, cold-load measurements, and a corrected FMFT numerator-routing error
with revalidated offline terminal projections and the completed public-backend
numerical matrices. The saved programs load once without regenerating rules.
See the
[matched generation measurements](docs/four_loop_generation_comparison.md)
for completed versus interrupted runs and output-equivalence qualifications.

K1/K3/K6 artifacts and offline master projections are shipped with Vakint.
GammaLoop milestone `433e42d3` corrects MATAD's signed routing for contracted
three-loop numerator momenta. After the independently audited 34-test targeted
gate, a fresh rerun of the **complete recorded 83-test selection passes:
83 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored**. Both previously failing all-class comparisons
reach all five three-loop classes, with unchanged tolerances. Native evaluation
uses an invalid FORM path; separate oracle lanes use FORM for validation.
The 83-test selection covers native peers, legacy comparisons, matching,
defaults and the offline 38-terminal catalog; it is not 83 distinct integrals.
GammaLoop milestone `a3d26dab` repeats that complete selection successfully on
the published Symbolica 3/RustRed stack and ships the regenerated K6 artifact.
The full workspace compiles; focused GammaLoop, Spenso and FeynKit runtime
checks pass. See the [dependency migration report](docs/vakint_symbolica3_migration.md).

Four-loop certified artifacts are not yet closed or shipped; the uncertified
candidate programs and their terminal projections are shipped with Vakint.
H, X, BMW and FG are
[external unit-mass input families](examples/input/README.md), not hard-coded
solver cases. Explicit caller-owned publication and cold-load resource policies,
native coefficient-conjunction refinement and exhaustive short-axis consistency
checks pass **629 focused core tests** and independent review. Defaults are
unchanged; larger finite allowances expose the next proof obligations. The
earlier recorded public release CLI attempts distinguish whole-sector certification
from later durable-artifact publication:

| Family | Exact sector audits | Remaining publication obstruction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H | **314/314**, 21,360/21,360 replayed and descending rules, zero gaps/issues | 72 sectors lowered; new guard proof at H58, displayed rule77; 308.58s whole process |
| FG | **124/124**, 9,272/9,272 replayed and descending rules, zero gaps/issues | 82 sectors lowered; new guard proof at FG83, displayed rule59; 283.58s whole process |
| BMW | **134/134**, 9,024/9,024 replayed and descending rules, zero gaps/issues | 31 sectors lowered; next guard of BMW230 displayed rule49; 568.98s whole process |
| X | 144 passing audits, 8,893 replayed/descending rules, zero gaps/issues | X394 is cleared; X369 preparation rejects a 33rd predicate under its independent 32-atom cap; 551.93s whole process |

The H/FG/BMW candidate systems pass all sector checks, but still do **not**
produce a durable, cold-validated artifact. The CLI, Rust and Python interfaces
expose separate producer/load allowances, never serialized as artifact authority.
These runs selected 65,536 endpoint-storage cells and 67,108,864 consistency
work units; all local proof checks remain mandatory. The previous H282/FG158
obstructions now pass complete lowering. New H/FG guards have an affine
consequence hidden behind a domain-proved nonzero factor; BMW's next guard
adds a factor already covered by a retained exclusion. Reusing native factor
evidence is the next narrow refinement. X's new failure is a preparation
resource cap, not a mathematical uncovered-domain witness. These observations
identify verification limitations, not demonstrated missing IBPs, but do not
prove the rest of X's unchecked sectors complete. Integer/finite-field sampling
will guide diagnostics and exact work, never replace infinite-domain closure.
A short X replay CPU profile again finds native rational-polynomial elimination
dominating the sampled interval; that is a separate runtime issue. The
[guard-consistency report](docs/research/four_loop_predicate_consistency.md)
records exact boundaries, evidence and next steps.
**No closed four-loop artifact is written or shipped.** Current
release CLI K1/K3/K6 generation, fresh-process validation and master-only
application pass with unchanged artifact bytes and exact reductions. K6 output
is identical across one, two and six configured workers and sufficient resource
policies. A fresh release wheel passes all 29 public Python API tests, including
CLI parity. Shared-host timings are not controlled speed ratios.
See the
[certificate profiling report](docs/research/original_source_certificate_performance.md).
Live phase diagnostics and an explicit domain-scoped publication path are
implemented: `--nonpositive-indices` restricts specified auxiliary
coordinates without bounding numerator rank or weakening exact closure checks.
The unrestricted default is unchanged. A conservative source-projection fix
resolves the earlier three-rule FG boundary failure without weakening replay.
The
[parent-probe report](docs/four_loop_parent_closure_probe.md) records the evidence.
Earlier pending-three-loop development checkpoints
below are historical and do not override this status.

The currently evidenced core can:

- automatically traverse coordinate and affine integer-equality cases with the compact `solver` API,
  precondition polynomial IBPs, discover matching modular GPLU pivots, replay
  compact exact traces, refine exceptional conditions, and share numerical
  searches among fully fixed cases. Its first full `vac3` run reproduced
  all 617 reference equations across 38 sectors with symbolic mass; independent
  audits matched the guard domains and 38 residual keys. See the
  [timing and validation report](docs/spired_vac3_results.md);
- independently replay the full K6 set from its nine original IBPs, prove
  descent and whole-sector coverage with 38 finite terminals, and obtain
  zero uncovered regions for all 617 rules at one and six workers. This cold
  audit also passes the complete K1/K3 families. The canonical unit-mass K6
  program now installs into the existing `ClosedArtifact` and
  memoizing `Reducer`: 623 rules, 5,640 sign-refined cells, 38 finite masters,
  and 26 proved-zero sectors. Serial and six-worker generation writes identical
  durable bytes; fresh CLI loading and application pass. Complete Vakint
  acceptance now passes the complete selected matrix described above. See
  the [artifact delivery report](docs/spired_vakint_artifact_plan.md);
- run those independent sector solves on a bounded private worker pool with
  shared source data and deterministic aggregate output. All `vac3` equations
  and residuals agree at 1/2/4/6 workers; see the
  [parallel timing and memory measurements](docs/spired_parallel_results.md);
- derive and remove independent linear-cut derivatives, retain exact parameter
  conditions, and support reference-compatible ordering permutations. The full
  two-loop PM `fam1_11` run matches all 802 sector rules, both preliminary rules,
  and 16 residual keys at 1/2/4/6 workers. Release campaign medians are 264 ms
  serial and 66 ms with six workers, versus C++ 739 ms and 131 ms; see the
  [PM benchmark and validation report](docs/spired_fam1_11_results.md);
- match all 856 `bc4PMRad1` rules and all 15 selected `fam_cosmo` rules,
  including exact guards and residual keys. Repeated `bc4PMRad1` end-to-end
  medians are 736 ms serial and 180 ms with six workers, versus C++ 1805 ms
  and 272 ms; see the
  [additional-fixture results](docs/spired_additional_fixtures.md);
- solve all 40 requested `fam1_12` sectors (1,104 nonempty rules) and all 132
  requested `fam1_111` sectors (10,333 rules), matching exact required domains,
  guards, coefficients, and residual keys. Seven-pair `fam1_12` process medians
  are 741 ms serial and 292 ms with six workers, versus C++ 1,883 ms and 384 ms.
  This verifies the reference rule finder, not certified family closure; see
  the [affine-case results](docs/spired_affine_results.md);
- compile compact, structured-text, and caller-owned Symbolica Atom family
  descriptions, authenticating every form at ingress;
- build exact topology-neutral affine integral families;
- generate the complete ordinary parametric IBP and LI source rows;
- exactly replay physical family rows/common-scale claims, retain auxiliary
  roles, and structurally validate caller-attested presentation metadata;
- project scalar, odd-rank, and rank-two vacuum tensors and, through a
  separate post-projection service, lower polynomial loop--loop scalar
  numerators onto shifted family keys with explicit common-mass powers;
- derive both a guarded rule at one concrete anchor and a genuine fixed-sector
  parametric recurrence over `K(n)`, accepting the latter only after exact
  symbolic replay, uniform descent proofs, retained nonzero guards, and
  exact base-field source replay at the declared anchor, with an optional
  requested-pivot path that performs deterministic Symbolica RREF over
  physical pivots, keeps chronological provenance columns as free source
  weights, and retains every reachable pivot guard;
- refine sector-monotone RHS shifts into lazy exact fixed-target-sector cells
  and stream preflighted O(1), rule-bound proper-subsector obligation
  descriptors with stable process-local resume and on-demand domain
  materialization;
- verify explicit affine symmetry maps;
- analyze requested zero sectors using generic Symanzik/rank evidence; and
- provide deterministic core-owned campaign execution and memory-preflight
  primitives, with roots-only composition in the application layer;
- drive one private SpIReD target lane from fair signed-L1 source scheduling
  through direct `c(n+s)` finite-field evaluation, incremental Symbolica rank
  separation, compact dependency tracing, fresh exact replay, and strict
  `RuleCell` promotion; exact indexed-guard witnesses now admit zero/nonzero
  branches and reject stale probes or unlucky primes before streaming; the
  scheduler-driven K1 regression additionally compiles its admitted cell into
  an executable owner and publishes a closed bounded wave against a separate
  no-rule terminal authority, while recursive multi-case closure and complete
  artifact publication remain in progress;
- rebase independent modular hits onto one fresh canonical exact epoch,
  promote only globally applicable candidates into guarded executable cells,
  pair those cells with their exact semantic circuits, and transactionally
  rebuild an immutable all-rank owner cover while retaining guard and terminal
  incompleteness explicitly;
- freshly generate, exactly replay, and seal the complete canonical one-loop
  `K = 1` and equal-mass two-loop sunset `K = 3` vacuum partitions over
  `Q(d)`, including explicit masters, scaleless zero terminals, exact `S3`
  routing, pinched-face factorization, exceptional numerator-corner cells,
  and checked common-mass homogeneity; and
- apply a sealed artifact with the topology-independent `reduction::Reducer`,
  using deterministic first-applicable rule selection, concrete strict-descent
  checks, an explicit work stack, memoization with retained-payload limits,
  like-master collection, typed uncovered/cycle failures, and optional common-
  mass restoration; and
- deterministically encode both sealed artifacts, authenticate and replay them
  once when loading untrusted bytes, and expose durable generation,
  inspection, and exact reduction through the Rust application API, the
  `campaign` CLI, and `import rustred` Python API; and
- drive Vakint's opt-in `EvaluationMethod::RustRed` scalar backend through the
  shipped `K = 1`, `K = 3` and `K = 6` artifacts, reusing Vakint's existing matcher and
  routing witness, returning exact terminal coefficients, restoring
  a symbolic or exact common mass, and optionally applying Vakint's pure-Rust
  offline master projections and values without invoking or falling back to FORM.

It does **not** yet provide complete four-loop artifacts or four-loop
acceptance, complete the
supplied PM example suite, or implement a new generic
higher-even-rank tensor reducer. Vakint uses FeynKit for that tensor prepass.
RustRed itself deliberately does not
own evaluated master values; the Vakint adapter can substitute Vakint's
existing values after reduction. Structural source counts—at any loop
count—remain insufficient closure evidence.

## Active development stage

The through-three-loop artifact milestone produced unit-mass artifacts for the one-loop
`K = 1`, two-loop `K = 3`, and three-loop `K = 6` vacuum families. Together
they cover Vakint's eight registered graph classes through three loops:
the tadpole, the sunset and its pinch, and the K4/Mercedes parent with four
inequivalent contractions. Their complete ordinary-source counts are 1, 4,
and 9 respectively.

The `K = 1` and `K = 3` families are installed as mathematically closed,
deterministically encoded artifacts and consumed by the generic recursive
reducer through Rust, CLI, and Python surfaces. They are also shipped with and
consumed by Vakint's FORM-free scalar backend. The new SpIRed producer closes
and durably installs canonical three-loop `K = 6`; fresh-process inspection
and application pass. The complete recorded Vakint acceptance selection passes.

The active four-loop work uses external H, X, BMW and FG parent inputs,
each with ten scalar-product coordinates. A single ten-coordinate root family
is not assumed universal. The generic `family-close` CLI runs complete-sector
generation and exact artifact installation over the declared domain (unrestricted
by default); see [its contract](docs/CLI.md).
Four-loop routing, shipped offline master catalogs and FORM-less numerical
parity already operate through the explicitly uncertified candidate-program
lane. Exact unrestricted artifact publication remains a separate unfinished
gate; passing numerical comparisons does not promote those candidates.

### Earlier foundry research checkpoints

The following records describe the separate earlier foundry/campaign lane,
not the current SpIRed producer's closure status. Its bounded frontiers do not
override the complete K6 artifact described above.

The earlier foundry lane's test-only K6
pressure fixture
pins its exact family, nine sources, order-24 `S4` sector partition, the five
revision-stamped Vakint class/routing snapshots, and certified `K3 x K1` plus
both inequivalent `K1 x K1 x K1` factorization sectors. It also derives the
first exact top-sector rule cell and the two inequivalent positive dotted-edge
cells on the canonical five-line residual face. Each cell is projected from
all nine sources and retains exact residual replay, guards, bounded application
proof, provenance, and strict descent. Six further generated cells advance the
five-line inactive-numerator partition: disjoint endpoint and bulk owners for
the all-unit active-power lane, the adjacent active-dot orbit, and the opposite
active-dot orbit. They retain exact source selections, endpoint specialization
and pruning, held-out replay, machine-boundary coverage, and strict descent; the
five-line scalar corner and the rest of the fixed point remain explicit
obligations. On the irreducible four-line face, an exact target-aligned
translation supplies a guarded canonical-dot multi-excess
cell, while the untranslated span supplies the canonical mixed
numerator/dot cell, including its isolated mixed corner. A complete depth-one
search now also supplies disjoint endpoint and bulk owners for the scalar
inactive-numerator ray `J(0,1,1,1,1,n)`, covering every representable `n<0`.
The selected bulk rows are independently reprojected over the full i64 box;
one exposed pinched child is now continued by separate generated endpoint and
bulk cells for `J(0,0,2,n,1,1)` and then `J(0,0,1,n,1,1)`, again through the
full representable negative-power domain. Exact orbit tests limit the
decorated cell to one of five inequivalent `S4` orbits; the other orbits
remain explicit obligations. Exact
fixed-corner projections additionally lower the isolated pure-dot orbit to the scalar
corner and supply a strict-descent recurrence for the opposite two-dot orbit
from the complete nine-row one-dot translated source layer, with exact RREF
selecting five rows. A topology-neutral bounded same-sector search now grows
complete L1 translation diamonds deterministically; its first successful
depth-two cone contains 28 translations and all 252 translated ordinary rows.
An independent finite reachability planner applies caller-ordered rule cells
with exact terminal/guard/coefficient semantics, strict descent, symmetry
routing, and bounded deterministic uncovered-frontier reporting. It is a
discovery aid, not a substitute for the symbolic proof required to publish a
closing artifact. On the factorized four-line face, the untranslated nine-row
span now also derives compact endpoint/bulk cells for the bridge-dot numerator
orbit `J(0,n,2,1,1,1)`, covering every representable `n<0`. The endpoint
terminates in authenticated product sectors; the bulk descends into two
simpler path-numerator lanes. One of them, `J(-1,0,1,0,2,1)`, now has an exact
singleton owner selected from two of the complete nine untranslated rows; it
continues only to the installed decorated-path endpoint and an authenticated
product. The other direct child, `J(0,-1,1,1,1,1)`, now has a separate
depth-one endpoint cell selected from 8 of 63 complete rows. Its sole guard is
`d-1`, and all three children are authenticated products; deeper negative
powers remain explicitly open. A distinct two-dot placement,
`J(0,-1,2,2,1,1)`, is owned by another exact endpoint selected from 9 of the
same 63-row search span. Independent compact reprojection removes the
complete-system's spurious `d-1` guard, and its four children terminate in
factorization owners 2, 0, 1, and 2. The six inequivalent `S4` placement
classes are exhaustively partitioned, so neighboring dot or numerator
patterns are not overclaimed. The irreducible four-line numerator lanes are
grouped under the semantic `four_line::numerator` module. Its newest exact
endpoint owns only the `S4` orbit of `J(0,1,2,2,1,-1)`, where the inactive
numerator is incident to both active dots. A complete depth-one search retains
all 63 rows and selects ordinals 18, 21, 27, 28, and 30; independent compact
reprojection removes the complete elimination's spurious `6-3d` guard. Its
four children route through the existing adjacent-pair and triple-dot cells,
factorization owner 2, and the still-open scalar corner. The other two
inequivalent two-dot/inactive-numerator placement classes remain explicitly
unowned. Two further endpoints own the undotted and one-dot members of the
opposite-inactive-numerator-pair class, respectively
`J(-1,1,1,1,1,-1)` and `J(-1,1,1,1,2,-1)`. The undotted rule selects four
rows from a complete 63-row depth-one span and retains only the effective
`3d-4` guard; the dotted rule selects two of the nine untranslated rows and is
guard-free. Both share `J(0,0,1,-1,2,1)`, whose separate guard-free depth-zero
endpoint selects rows 0 and 3 and closes through the installed undotted-path
cell and factorization owner 2. Exact orbit tests keep all three cells narrow.
On the irreducible scalar four-line face, a
separate depth-zero bulk recurrence covers the full machine-wide ray
`J(0,1,1,1,2,N)`, `N<=-2`. It independently reprojects rows 0, 3, and 4 of
the complete nine-row source span, is guard-free, reaches `i64::MIN`, and
routes only to the installed scalar-numerator/decorated-path lanes or the
already-open scalar corner. Exact `S4` tests own all eight equivalent
dot/numerator placements while rejecting the endpoint, higher-dot, two-dot,
and two-negative neighbors. A depth-one continuation now covers the deeper
opposite inactive-pair ray `J(-1,1,1,1,1,N)`, `N<=-2`, from five selected
generated rows. Its first new child is closed by a coordinated three-line
cluster: two machine-wide inactive-pair rays and one shifted-dot ray are
independently reprojected from complete ordinary-source spans with exact
guards, replay, descent, and `S4` ownership. These additions replace one
finite frontier witness without treating any sampled miss as a terminal.

The current test-only K6 census submits 115 bounded probes, which canonicalize
to 44 roots and discover 89 nodes. It applies rules 53 times from 46 registered
cells, discharges 27 nodes only by freshly proved zero/factorization terminals,
and leaves nine nodes explicitly uncovered: the three scalar-corner
certification obligations and six genuine recurrence witnesses enumerated in
the [breakthrough research note](docs/research/parametric_ibp_breakthrough.md).
Two independent complete depth-two projections now also lower the
adjacent and opposite placements of powers two and three on the four-line
corner. Exact elimination selects 17 and 18 source contributions respectively;
both rules descend only to the certified path factorization and the unresolved
scalar four-line corner. The three scalar graph corners, deeper mixed-dot
faces, and remaining numerator directions remain obligations rather than implicit
masters.
The test-only completion geometry independently maps all 46 cells to exact
sector-local carrier boxes and checks 33,534 small-lattice membership points.
The foundry expands every one of the 205 retained guard occurrences in the
base parameters with Symbolica. Of these, 119 have an immediate nonzero
constant coefficient; the other 86 have exact one-index exceptional sets, and
none of their roots intersects the owning application box. Thus the current
cells have no hidden guard-zero holes. Their guard-blind structural complements
still contain 20 and 32 disjoint boxes in the two sectors containing the six
recurrence witnesses, with a six-dimensional varying component in each. Even
endpoints that saturate the `i64` carrier remain explicit all-rank extension
obligations rather than assumed rays.
Exact targeted RREF selects 16 of those rows and supplies a guarded two-term,
strictly descending recurrence for the inequivalent adjacent two-dot orbit,
while complete provenance and projection replay retain the full search span.
The resulting fixed-corner cells route all three dotted orbits under the exact
`S4` action. The same complete diamond also derives the opposite-pair rule's
single-line triple-dot descendant, again from 16 selected rows with exact
guards and full 252-row replay; both children are the certified path
factorization and the scalar four-line corner. A third target over a separately
retained copy of the complete span lowers the remaining three-distinct-dot
orbit onto the same two children using 17 selected rows and nine exact guards;
`S4` routes all four raw placements. A fourth complete depth-two projection
derives the selected repeated-edge ray `J(0,1,1,1,N,0)` for `N >= 3`. Its
pivot shift is `[0,0,0,0,2,0]`; exact elimination selects 50 source
contributions containing 358 source terms and produces eight RHS terms, 32
guards, and 367 replay keys. Schema-V4 replay takes 1078 exact operations at
free index one and 1080 at held-out indices two and eight. A symbolic
leading-coefficient proof establishes that none of the 32 specialized guards
becomes the zero polynomial in `d` for any positive free index, while concrete
exceptional dimensions remain guarded. Exact `S4` routing covers every choice
of the repeated active edge. A complete depth-three search over 84 translations
and 756 ordinary rows next derives the exact corner target
`J(0,1,2,2,3,0)`. Its exact elimination selects 46 generated rows. Reprojecting
only that generated selection on a one-free-index face yields an algebraic
recurrence for one `S4` orbit of `J(0,1,2,2,N,0)`, structurally `N >= 3`,
with 13 source contributions, 90 source terms, five RHS terms, seven guards,
96 replay keys, and 275 exact
schema-V4 operations. The anchor free index one and held-out indices two and
eight replay identically, and a symbolic leading-coefficient proof covers the
complete positive ray. The concrete i64 rule cell owns
`3 <= N <= i64::MAX - 1`; the final machine endpoint is rejected because an
RHS shift would overflow. A separate complete depth-three projection closes the
first point of the complementary orbit, `J(0,1,2,3,2,0)`: exact elimination
selects 46 of 756 generated rows (310 source terms), producing four RHS terms,
22 guards, 315 replay keys, and 939 exact schema-V4 operations. Depths zero
through two retain typed target-absent results, the fixed application box owns
only this `S4` orbit point, and neighboring points remain explicitly unowned.
The remaining complementary ray, the exposed descendant
`J(0,1,1,2,N,0)`, inequivalent path-numerator orbits, other numerator faces,
scalar corners, and the rest of the fixed point remain open.

RustRed does not require the eventual evaluation-terminal set to be a minimal
master basis. An exactly proved finite complement may be shipped as a larger,
versioned terminal set, provided each entry has an exact MATAD basis map or a
separately validated, shipped high-precision Laurent evaluation at Stage 1
(with AMFlow serving the analogous later high-loop role). The current nine
bounded K6 misses are not such a proof: recurrence
witnesses may sit on infinite uncovered strata and therefore cannot simply be
declared masters. Vakint/MATAD may be used offline to diagnose their missing
relations and to produce high-precision reference values; neither is part of
the production RustRed scalar path. FORM recurrences may inform seed points,
coordinate orderings, and validation targets, but a production K6 artifact and
its Python example must regenerate every identity with RustRed. Importing FORM
recurrence right-hand sides is diagnostic-only and cannot publish an artifact
or supply a claimed generation time.

K6 closure is being driven in two distinct modes. The hinted mode may use
reviewed external search metadata—currently itinerary, proof/proposal order,
probe portfolio, and bounded resource choices—but RustRed still regenerates
every identity and produces a standalone artifact containing no FORM payload.
The autonomous mode receives no FORM-derived hints and must discover that
search guidance itself. Both modes must satisfy the identical exact closure,
replay, durable reload, and reduction gates; only the autonomous result closes
the algorithmic Stage 1 objective.

The strict V2 campaign schema makes this distinction structural rather than a
relabelable provenance flag. An autonomous request contains only the preset and
bounded report ceilings; RustRed chooses its proof order, discovery chronology,
probe portfolio, and itinerary deterministically. For example:

```toml
schema = "rustred.foundry-campaign-config.toml.v2"
preset = "three-loop-unit-mass-vacuum-k6-orbit-0"
mode = "autonomous"
max_task_reports = 512
max_reported_uncovered_boxes = 64
```

An externally informed run instead requires a reviewed `[hints]` object. That
object may choose only supported search inputs such as the itinerary, proof and
proposal order, probe portfolio, and bounded resource choices:

```toml
schema = "rustred.foundry-campaign-config.toml.v2"
preset = "three-loop-unit-mass-vacuum-k6-orbit-0"
mode = "external-hints-only"
max_task_reports = 512
max_reported_uncovered_boxes = 64

[hints]
itinerary = "full-rank-atomic-waves"
interior_margin = 2
polynomial_degree_ceiling = 0
ordering_policy = "rustred.unshifted-sector-order.v1;priority=rustred.coordinate-priority.v1;k=6;rank-by-slot=5,3,4,2,0,1"
discovery_coordinate_priority = [5, 3, 4, 2, 0, 1]

[[hints.probes]]
modulus = 1000000007
base_parameters = [37]
chart_offsets = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Unknown fields are rejected, and neither variant has a representation for
recurrence right-hand sides, coefficients, source rows, supports, or imported
rules. `rustred campaign run` selects the autonomous single-sector itinerary;
`rustred campaign run-waves --n-cores N` selects the autonomous full-rank wave
itinerary. External hints state the same itinerary explicitly and are rejected
at the wrong entry point. Single-sector reports remain diagnostic and carry
`artifact_published = false`. Full-wave reports distinguish an exact in-memory
`artifact_installed` result from `durable_artifact_published`: the latter is
true only after deterministic K6 encoding, independent cold-load validation,
exact regenerated-source replay, and canonical re-encoding all succeed. An
incomplete run exposes no artifact bytes; it instead reports each blocking
orbit's typed stop and exact residual-box census, with partition coordinates
bounded per orbit by `max_reported_uncovered_boxes` and an explicit truncation
flag. The corresponding Python functions are
`rustred.run_foundry_campaign(config)` and
`rustred.run_foundry_wave_campaign(config, n_cores=N)`.

The repository includes two directly runnable, reviewable full-wave inputs:
[`examples/k6_external_search_hints.toml`](examples/k6_external_search_hints.toml)
contains the 55 raw anchor/axis rectangles from the externally informed
itinerary, while
[`examples/k6_autonomous_campaign.toml`](examples/k6_autonomous_campaign.toml)
contains no hints at all. The former carries search chronology only; it has no
identity rows, right-hand sides, coefficients, supports, reductions, owners,
terminals, or master payload. Both can be passed unchanged to release CLI and
Python runs, and both remain bounded investigations until exact K6 closure is
reported.

Live matcher comparison remains an integration gate, and no artifact is
published before the complete rule fixed point closes.

Tensor-reducer development is explicitly outside Stage 1. Vakint's
`vakint_rustred` branch is based on GammaLoop's `feynkit` branch and uses its
native FORM-less tensor prepass before the RustRed scalar backend. Existing
experimental RustRed rank-two tensor code remains frozen through Stage 1.
After the complete through-three-loop artifact and Vakint acceptance gate is
recorded and pushed, Stage 2 is authorized to proceed directly with four-
through six-loop closure, the required high-loop execution infrastructure,
and integration of the collaborator's advanced rank-generic tensor technology
when it is available. Algorithm research, bounded K6 foundry experiments, and
census-complete K10/K15/K21 scaling studies remain active during Stage 1;
none is described as production closure before the exact publication gates
pass. LiteRed2 is the correctness control, while modular
target-separation, exact lattice-stratum completion, seedless syzygy sources,
generating-function operators, and decorated graph/minor reuse are evaluated
as possible routes beyond its scaling. See [`GOAL.md`](GOAL.md) for the
authoritative gates.

The current test-only A0 kernel samples the canonical degree-one `S4a`
physical frame (63 ordinary-source rows, 157 raw integral columns, and 630
structural entries) directly over Symbolica `Zp64`. An exhaustive
decorated-stratum registry classifies every raw column as the target, a proved
strictly descending RHS with all proper-subsector images terminal-owned, or a
forbidden column. The registry admits lower images only from immutable sealed-
artifact zero, factorization, or master owners; it never upgrades an ordinary
RuleCell into closure authority.

The current source-discovery boundary constructs every requested task natively
with target shift zero. `SampledDeclaredModuleDual` can seal one complete,
guard-free fixed-sample empty residual census after independently replaying all
inverse-incidence and translated-term/support counts and rejoining the exact
plan, sample, partition, stratum, ordering, lower-owner snapshot, and incidence
index. A bounded multi-epoch driver now executes a prevalidated probe schedule
in declared order. Each probe owns its request accumulator, selected matrices,
samples, obstructions, and exact-lift result; cross-probe state is bounded
scalar telemetry only. Live hits are lifted before their query-local evidence
can escape, guarded dual evidence fails closed, and aggregate exhaustion marks
the unexecuted suffix explicitly. No arbitrary-target coordinate-transport
subsystem exists yet.

The test-only K6 campaign also has a proof-backed terminal authority that is
not a synthetic closing artifact. It authenticates the exact zero and
factorization cover once, binds symmetry to the family, strongly retains the
closed K1/K3 dependencies, and requires its terminal manifest to equal the
compiled factorization images. Immutable completion snapshots flatten that
cover for lookup while retaining the exact authority for cold verification.

Its first audited campaign census covers all six full-rank sector orbits at
three independent primes. Every one-epoch task builds 90 rows, 253 columns,
and 918 structural entries; none has an immediate target-unit hit, and the
right obstruction nominates 3,586--3,822 additional nonzero translations.
Those are diagnostic proposal counts, not installed rules or evidence of
closure. The current bounded follow-up derives `q0` plus as many as three
target-normalized `q0 + z_i` directions from the same checked Symbolica RREF,
replays every direction, evaluates their union support through a probe-local
complete-row cache, and selects at most 32 rows by marginal signature rank plus
one deterministic breadth slot. On both first path/star sectors, width one and
width four preserve the same authoritative q0 census and grow the frame from
90 to 122 requests. Width four incurs only the additional auxiliary-support
evaluations, but this one-epoch experiment still produces no modular hit or
exact-lift attempt. The path/star closure baselines remain `9/4/10` and
`22/12/4`; that checkpoint had no K6 artifact. These results motivated the next
fixed-slice/syzygy-guided discovery experiment and immutable solved-sector
feedback work instead of a blind larger seed box.

Positive finite-field supports can now be lifted over Symbolica's exact
rational-function field. The lift recovers the original translated-source
combination, retains every pivot/source/denominator guard, and independently
replays all physical columns. Probe-local exact results now enter a bounded
canonical-replay transaction before promotion: only raw probes and complete
request sets cross worker boundaries; old circuits are discarded; bootstrap
and the exact request union are rebuilt as one fresh epoch; and one
authenticated target/lower-owner partition is shared read-only while every
probe is independently resampled. The common domain must lie inside every
contributing final domain. Structural exact-lift failures abort the whole
transaction, while sample singularities, no-hits, and support-not-lifted
outcomes remain explicit diagnostics.

Fresh exact circuits are sorted by proof content rather than modular telemetry
and deduplicated under aggregate work, diagnostic, exact-payload, integer-bit,
anchor, and support-reference limits. A genuine distinct-request regression
builds an epoch-one union and proves that no stale plan token crosses it. The
selected common-plan candidate then passes exact guard refinement, lossless
lowering, descent/source replay, and ordinary guarded `RuleCell` admission;
the admitted value keeps its epoch and circuit authority alongside the
executable cell. Guard walls remain typed retry or exceptional-stratum
obligations, never implicit coverage.

The canonical replay-to-publication bridge is now executable and bounded. It
authenticates the shared partition once, retries a guard wall only at distinct
exact anchors in canonical coordinate order, admits only globally applicable
`RuleCell`s, keeps ordinary guard obstructions beside the unpublished exact
authority, and pointer-pairs each admitted cell with its semantic circuit.
Whole-cover compilation canonically sorts owners and terminals; insertion
publishes only after a complete replacement cover and every pairing check
succeeds. `Incomplete` remains the only answer for an unbounded geometric
complement, unresolved guard branch, or undeclared finite terminal. A consuming
seal now rejects every such incomplete cover, strongly retains the exact
predecessor snapshot, and rechecks the complete common execution scope of every
owner while preserving the existing proof/circuit/`RuleCell` pairing. A sealed
cover can now be published as an immutable solved-sector layer with a bounded,
one-time BLAKE3 identity over its complete executable content. Strong retained
ownership—not the digest—authorizes dependency joins. Later snapshots append
canonically ordered same-rank waves transactionally and reject split,
decreasing, or foreign-predecessor publication. Their bounded append-only
raw-to-owner route table now covers every authenticated symmetry image of root
and solved owners, retains the exact canonicalizer authority, preserves
factorization-before-master precedence, and performs allocation-free bucketed
lookup. A generic one-shot coordinator now stages a complete same-rank
frontier against one exact predecessor, accepts only pointer-paired executable
owners and retained-authority terminals, resolves equivalent worker results by
an exact canonical minimum, and enforces aggregate rather than per-sector
resource limits. It publishes no layer unless every sector is exactly closed.
On the K6 rank-three path/star frontier, the exact
root-aware degree-one diagnostic currently gives `9/4/10` and `22/12/4`
(replayed owners / guard-total owners / nonfinite complement boxes), so the
atomic wave correctly stops without publication. That lane's next production
boundary was the first complete bottom-up three-line wave. It is separate from
the now-closed source-port K6 artifact.

### Compatibility policy

The codebase has no RustRed backward-compatibility promise during deep
development. Obsolete prototype solvers, schemas, compatibility facades,
authored recurrences, and milestone-log architecture have been deleted rather
than migrated. Durable artifacts accept the current RustRed schema only: every
obsolete version, including V1 through V4, is rejected and there is no migration
or dual decoder. Vakint likewise provides no compatibility layer for obsolete
RustRed artifact schemas. This does not weaken Vakint's separate API/default
and existing FORM-method compatibility contract.

## Workspace

The repository root is a virtual Cargo workspace with three packages:

- `crates/rustred-core` is package and library `rustred`; it owns exact
  algebra, families, normalized input, identities, sectors, tensor and foundry
  services, sealed artifacts, deterministic reduction, and generic campaign
  primitives.
- `crates/rustred-app` owns shared application operations and the `rustred`
  CLI. Transport schemas and presentation stay here rather than in the
  mathematical core. Library consumers can set `default-features = false`
  to load/apply saved programs without the CLI's terminal-UI dependencies;
  the default `cli` feature and executable behavior are unchanged.
- `crates/rustred-python` is a thin PyO3 adapter over `rustred-app`. Python
  users write `import rustred`; `rustred._rustred` is a private extension
  detail, and top-level `import _rustred` is intentionally unsupported.

The registry-shaped Symbolica 3.0.0 development dependency is patched to
`vendor/symbolica`, whose submodule update branch is `dev` and whose parent
repository pin selects an exact commit. It is built with the `integer-gmp` and
`float-mpfr` backends. Symbolica is the sole production CAS, including its
native finite-field and rational-polynomial reconstruction APIs used by the
opt-in SpIReD semi-numerical route. RustRed never
invokes FORM, Mathematica, SymPy, or authored recurrence tables.

## Development

Use the pinned Nix environment. Licensed or multicore Symbolica operations
need `SYMBOLICA_LICENSE` set before the first Symbolica object or worker pool is
created.

```bash
nix develop --command cargo fmt --all -- --check
SYMBOLICA_LICENSE=... nix develop --command cargo check --workspace --all-targets
SYMBOLICA_LICENSE=... nix develop --command cargo test --workspace --all-targets
```

Inspect the current CLI contract with:

```bash
nix develop --command cargo run -p rustred-app --bin rustred -- --help
```

The root `pyproject.toml` builds the Python distribution. The public smoke test
is:

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
maturin develop --features extension-module
python -c 'import rustred'
```

### Selected saved-rule circuit diagnostics

`SourcePortAudit::replay_sector_rule_circuits` optionally retains the exact
ordinary-IBP weights already recovered by native source replay, together with
their declared coordinate case, exceptions, denominator conditions and actual
raw pivot/recentering. The existing count-only replay APIs remain unchanged.
The returned batch borrows one audit context and its authenticated zero-sector
evidence; no coefficient strings are parsed and no new CAS implementation is
involved. Affine cases or affine exclusions currently return a typed refusal.

These are identities on the **declared guarded domain, modulo authenticated
zero sectors**—not unrestricted polynomial identities, descent proofs or closing
artifacts. Copied weights are proposals only: composition must retain the full
original-source product and pass the existing exact admission pipeline anew.
In particular, canonical source offsets already include the recovered recenter;
the separately reported raw recenter must not be applied a second time.

For a saved native candidate bundle, the scoped application adapter is
`rustred_app::with_replayed_candidate_rule_circuits`. A fallible consumer can
return `Ok(analyze(batch))` with its own `Result<T, E>` as the owned result,
keeping consumer errors separate from native replay errors. The input-driven
diagnostic example accepts a sector and strictly increasing, sector-local rule ordinals:

```bash
nix develop --command cargo run --release --locked -p rustred-app \
  --example replay_saved_rule_circuits -- request.json
```

For example, `request.json` for the first rule of a one-denominator candidate is:

```json
{
  "bundle": "owner.candidates.rrbin",
  "sector": [true],
  "ordinals": [0],
  "max_bundle_bytes": 134217728,
  "max_total_coefficient_bytes": 268435456,
  "max_collection_entries": 1000000,
  "max_coefficient_bytes": 16777216,
  "max_report_bytes": 1048576,
  "retention": {
    "max_rules": 2,
    "max_source_entries": 4096,
    "max_rhs_terms": 4096,
    "max_conditions": 65536,
    "max_coefficient_terms": 1000000,
    "max_coefficient_clone_owned_bytes": 67108864,
    "max_coordinate_cells": 1000000
  }
}
```

Use the sector and ordinals of your own bundle; they are runtime inputs, not
compiled topology choices. Successful output reports
`REPLAYED_DECLARED_DOMAIN_MODULO_AUTHENTICATED_ZEROS`, source offsets, case boxes,
guard counts and replay time. It never installs a rule or writes an artifact.
Retention limits are cumulative, pre-copy bounds on the retained observations,
not replay scratch or arbitrary callback memory. `max_report_bytes` limits
emitted JSON, not its construction; apply an external process-memory/time guard
when examining large inputs.

### Preferred saved-owner programs (research opt-in)

Fresh saved-owner campaigns can try a different, trusted generated program
before the original rules, while keeping **exactly the original terminal set**.
Add the following optional field to the existing selection JSON; paths use
the same owner-base directory as the baseline payloads:

```json
"preferred_owner_programs": [
  {
    "path": "preferred/alternative.rrbin",
    "bytes": 12345,
    "owner_mask": "111",
    "residual_policy": "defer-to-baseline"
  }
]
```

Use the actual payload size and original-coordinate mask. Each preference must
match an existing owner, family, saved root, mathematical order and generation
scope. Discovery visitation strategies may differ. Duplicate preferences and
preferences colliding with a repair overlay on the same owner are rejected.
Other owners' repair overlays remain unchanged.

Dispatch first recognizes baseline terminals. Preferred-only finite residuals
are explicit holes that skip the entire preferred program, even when a formula
overlaps them; they are **not additional masters**. Elsewhere preferred rules
run first, with baseline fallback only for native `Uncovered`. A denominator
exclusion is ordinary inapplicability; actual algebra, source-condition,
descent or resource errors still propagate. Symbolic domains are partitioned
exactly around the finite holes rather than approximated by a larger box.

The Rust entry points are
`CandidateOwnerPrograms::try_new_with_preferences` and
`rustred_app::load_generated_candidate_owners_with_preferences`.
The existing campaign CLI and Python staging use the same selection field;
omitting it preserves the original path. Both immutable payloads and the
explicit composition policy are bound into fresh checkpoints and cold loading.
This is **not** an in-place update of an existing campaign, a new source proof,
or a closure guarantee. Rule-local diagnostic APIs still inspect individual
formulas and do not establish composed-program applicability. Performance
benefits require matched full-worklist experiments, not rule-count comparisons.

## Durable closing artifacts

The semantic generation selectors are `unit-mass-vacuum-k1` for the canonical
one-loop family and `unit-mass-vacuum-k3` for the equal-mass two-loop sunset.
They are family selectors, not Vakint topology names. Generate a native binary
program, then inspect or apply those bytes. Coefficient values and proof payloads
are deterministic; serialized Symbolica State can include ambient registry
entries, so byte-for-byte identity across different process histories is not
promised. Load only trusted generated native files; exact source replay and
closure checks still run at the mathematical admission boundary:

```bash
rustred campaign generate \
  --family unit-mass-vacuum-k1 \
  --output one_loop.rr

rustred campaign inspect \
  --artifact one_loop.rr \
  --output one_loop.inspect.toml

rustred campaign reduce \
  --artifact one_loop.rr \
  --powers 3 \
  --output one_loop.I3.toml

rustred campaign generate \
  --family unit-mass-vacuum-k3 \
  --output two_loop_sunset.rr

rustred campaign reduce \
  --artifact two_loop_sunset.rr \
  --powers 2,2,1 \
  --output two_loop_sunset.I221.toml
```

For the complete three-loop family, supply the external K6 family to the
generic CLI, or use the public Python generation API:

```bash
rustred family-close --input examples/input/three_loop_k6.toml \
  --n-cores 6 --progress --output k6.rr
rustred campaign inspect --artifact k6.rr --output k6.inspect.toml
rustred campaign reduce --artifact k6.rr --powers 2,1,1,1,1,1

python examples/python/k6_closing_artifact.py another-k6.rr --generate --workers 6
```

Expected generation output includes 623 generated rules, 5,640 refined cells,
38 finite terminals and 26 zero sectors. The output
path must be new. The generic CLI and Python artifact readers apply these
bytes without rerunning rule discovery; cold loading regenerates ordinary IBP
rows and verifies the saved combinations. No dedicated family selector or
specialized generator binary is needed. The identifier-safe example family
label is part of its new artifact identity; existing Vakint assets are migrated
atomically with their loader and producer pin, not silently replaced.
See the [CLI](examples/cli/README.md#completed-k6-artifact),
[Python](examples/python/README.md), and
[Rust-library](examples/rust/README.md#complete-k6-closing-artifact) examples.

Artifact input and output also support standard streams. For example, this
inspects freshly generated bytes without a file:

```bash
rustred campaign generate --family unit-mass-vacuum-k1 \
  | rustred campaign inspect --artifact -
```

For target `I(3)`, reduction returns the typed master key `[1]`, exact
unit-mass coefficient
`(-6*rustred::{}::d+8+rustred::{}::d^2)*1/8`, and
`common_mass_squared_power = "-2"`; hence the complete coefficient is the
reported exact coefficient times `(mass_squared)^(-2)`. The power is a decimal
string in TOML because the generic homogeneity API uses a signed 128-bit
exponent while TOML integers are restricted to signed 64-bit values.

The Python surface uses immutable `bytes` directly:

```python
import rustred

generated = rustred.generate_closing_artifact(
    family=rustred.ClosingFamily.UNIT_MASS_VACUUM_K1,
)
artifact = generated.artifact
inspection = rustred.inspect_closing_artifact(artifact)
reduction = rustred.reduce_with_closing_artifact(artifact, [3])

term = reduction.terms[0]
assert term.master_powers == [1]
assert term.common_mass_squared_power == -2
```

Loading a trusted generated certified program checks its mathematical contents
and exactly replays its source identities once; recursive application then uses
the sealed owner without repeating those checks in the hot path. The native
Symbolica decoder is not an untrusted-file sandbox. The completed `K = 6`
example uses that same generation, cold-loading and application path.

## Reproducing Vakint's one- through four-loop rule packages

[`examples/python/generate_vakint_artifacts.py`](examples/python/generate_vakint_artifacts.py)
steers fresh native IBP generation from the input families used by Vakint. It
does not copy pre-existing rules. First initialize the patched dependency as
described in [Symbolica 3.0 development checkout](#symbolica-30-development-checkout).
Build the release CLI and its small public-API terminal-normalization helper
once, then run without recompiling:

```sh
mkdir -p TMP
export TMPDIR="$PWD/TMP" TMP="$PWD/TMP" TEMP="$PWD/TMP"
nix develop --command cargo build --release --locked -p rustred-app \
  --bin rustred --example normalize_candidate_terminals
nix develop --command python examples/python/generate_vakint_artifacts.py \
  --loops 1 2 3 --workers 6 --output-directory TMP/vakint-lower-generated --execute
nix develop --command python examples/python/generate_vakint_artifacts.py \
  --loops 4 --workers 6 --output-directory TMP/vakint-four-generated --execute
```

Set `SYMBOLICA_LICENSE` in the environment first. Output directories must be
new. Without `--execute`, the script prints its plan only. Four-loop generation
is unrestricted in numerator rank, uses all sectors with physical propagators
and nonpositive auxiliary indices, and can be substantially more expensive.
Worker count does not impose a RAM limit.

The lower-loop outputs are `unit_mass_vacuum_k{1,3,6}.rrbin`, plus fresh-process
inspection and sample-reduction reports. Four-loop outputs are compressed native
`{h,fg,bmw,x}.candidates.rrbin.gz` programs and `.rrnorm.bin` terminal-normalization
plans. These are the same native package kinds consumed by Vakint, not the
bounded starting-domain campaign format or a claim of unrestricted four-loop
closure certification.

Master **values** are a separate, precomputed input: optionally supply Vakint's
four-loop directory with `--catalog-directory` to validate exact output-key
coverage and copy its catalog alongside the generated rules. No FORM or master
evaluation runs here. See the [complete example instructions](examples/python/README.md#generating-vakints-rule-packages)
for filenames, scope, reference comparisons and expected output.

## One- and two-loop parametric-IBP examples

The [`examples/`](examples/) tree contains complete, runnable versions of the
same closing-artifact calculation through the Rust library, CLI, and Python
APIs. The registered `K = 3` family is the unit-mass presentation of

```text
D1 = k1^2 - 1
D2 = k2^2 - 1
D3 = (k1 + k2)^2 - 1.
```

RustRed generates all four ordinary sources, derives five guarded rule cells,
proves exact `S3` routing and four scaleless zero sectors, and factorizes the
two-line face through the immutable `K = 1` artifact. The two explicit masters
are `I(1,1,1)` and `I(0,1,1)`. An arbitrary common `m^2` is restored after
unit-mass reduction by the reported homogeneity power.

The shortest complete campaign is the one-loop Python example. It generates
and cold-loads the durable `K = 1` artifact, then reduces `I(3)` to `I(1)`:

```bash
uv venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
maturin develop --release --features extension-module
python examples/python/one_loop_single_mass_vacuum.py
```

Its generation TOML reports one ordinary source and one guarded rule. The
cold-loaded artifact has no uncovered branch; the reduction TOML reports
master `[1]` with `common_mass_squared_power = -2`.

The Rust example calls the public `rustred` crate directly:

```bash
cargo run --locked -p rustred-app --example two-loop-single-mass-vacuum
```

Its defining output is:

```text
algorithm = rustred.generated.two-loop-unit-mass-sunset.v1
ordinary_sources = 4
closing_rule_cells = 5
source = ordinary-ibp:0:0
source = ordinary-ibp:0:1
source = ordinary-ibp:1:0
source = ordinary-ibp:1:1
target = [2, 2, 1]
master [0, 1, 1]: ... mass_squared_power = -3
master [1, 1, 1]: ... mass_squared_power = -2
```

The CLI runner generates durable bytes, authenticates them, and reduces
`I(2,2,1)`:

```bash
sh examples/cli/run.sh
```

Its inspection TOML reports:

```toml
[artifact]
algorithm_id = "rustred.generated.two-loop-unit-mass-sunset.v1"
arity = 3

[validation]
source_rows = 4
guarded_rules = 5
master_terminals = 2
zero_sector_terminals = 4
```

[`examples/python/two_loop_single_mass_vacuum.py`](examples/python/two_loop_single_mass_vacuum.py)
uses the public package name `import rustred`, checks the complete five-cell
artifact, and verifies both exact master keys and mass powers:

```bash
uv venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
maturin develop --release --features extension-module
python examples/python/two_loop_single_mass_vacuum.py
```

## Vakint integration

Vakint development occurs in the independent GammaLoop repository on branch
`vakint_rustred`. The opt-in scalar API boundary
`EvaluationMethod::RustRed(RustRedEvaluationOptions)` and
`EvaluationOrder::rustred_only()` now support the one-loop tadpole, two-loop
sunset, and its pinch. The backend consumes Vakint's existing topology match
and simultaneous routing witness, applies shipped RustRed artifacts, returns
exact coefficients in Vakint's existing MATAD master basis, and optionally
reuses its pure-Rust master evaluations. It does not rematch graphs, regenerate
artifacts, invoke FORM, or fall back to another scalar reducer.

Vakint's public API conventions, defaults, and existing FORM-backed methods
remain backward-compatible. Legacy integral notation remains accepted, and
any newer FeynKit/RustRed spelling is additive and tested against its legacy
equivalent; obsolete RustRed artifact schemas deliberately do not remain
compatible. Tensor-bearing RustRed acceptance inputs explicitly use the FORM-less
FeynKit tensor prepass before the FORM-less RustRed scalar tail. Dedicated
invalid-FORM-path tests must cover that complete stack, while AlphaLoop and
MATAD remain offline comparison oracles executed with the separately built
official FORM5 binary. Broad raw-master and substituted-result
tests agree with MATAD through the previously validated two-loop baseline; the
post-rebase acceptance matrix is being revalidated. RustRed's experimental
tensor code is frozen and is not an active Stage 1 dependency.

Production `K = 1` and `K = 3` artifacts are generated once, checked into and
shipped with Vakint, and loaded rather than rediscovered during evaluation.
They are validated once at lazy load and reused thereafter. RustRed owns
guarded rule application and typed master keys; Vakint owns topology matching,
canonical routing, steering, normalization, presentation, and its existing
master values.
