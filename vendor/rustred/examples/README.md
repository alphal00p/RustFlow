# RustRed examples

The Rust, CLI, and Python examples generate the complete closing
parametric-IBP artifact for the two-loop single-scale vacuum sunset family.
RustRed derives four ordinary sources and five guarded rule cells, closes every
sector with exact `S3` routing, zero terminals, and one-loop factorization,
then reduces the sample integral `I(2,2,1)` to masters `I(1,1,1)` and
`I(0,1,1)`. The Python directory also contains the smaller complete one-loop
tadpole campaign used as a fast public-API smoke test.

[`input/four_loop_h.toml`](input/four_loop_h.toml) is a generic explicit
family-input example for a four-loop vacuum parent. It is deliberately kept
as user data rather than a RustRed built-in: the ten rows (nine physical
denominators plus an ISP at power zero) are parsed by the same strict TOML
frontend used for any supplied family. Use it with `rustred derive` as shown
in [the CLI documentation](../docs/CLI.md#four-loop-vacuum-input-external-family-data).
For a topology-neutral solver diagnostic, use the same input directly with
`rustred family-solve`; this path accepts arbitrary Project TOML and never
dispatches on the family name:

```console
rustred family-solve --input examples/input/four_loop_h.toml \
  --input-format toml --sectors 0000000001 --n-cores 4
```

- [`rust/`](rust/) uses the public `rustred` library directly.
- [`cli/`](cli/) uses `rustred family-close` and `campaign generate`, `inspect`, and `reduce`.
- [`python/`](python/) uses the public `import rustred` package and provides
  Python steering of native release executables for larger campaigns.

[`python/generate_vakint_artifacts.py`](python/generate_vakint_artifacts.py)
generates the one-, two-, three- and four-loop native rule programs consumed
by Vakint. It derives IBPs afresh, cold-checks its outputs, and produces
four-loop terminal-normalization plans. Numerical master values remain a
separate precomputed catalog. See the
[build/run instructions and expected files](python/README.md#generating-vakints-rule-packages).

The completed autonomous K=6 artifact is also generated and applied through
both surfaces. [`cli/run_k6_closing_artifact.sh`](cli/run_k6_closing_artifact.sh)
uses the generic release CLI and the external
[`input/three_loop_k6.toml`](input/three_loop_k6.toml), then cold-loads and
reduces the artifact. [`python/k6_closing_artifact.py`](python/k6_closing_artifact.py)
uses `rustred.family_close` when `--generate` is supplied; otherwise it only
loads and applies the given artifact. Neither path recompiles, invokes FORM,
or supplies authored reduction rules.

The artifact sets the common squared mass to one. Each reduction coefficient
also reports the exact power of `mass_squared` that restores a general common
mass by dimensional homogeneity.

No parameter declaration exists or is needed in these preset closing-artifact
workflows. In the separate generic `derive` input formats, RustRed infers
family scalars such as `d` and `m2`; their optional parameter allowlist is an
advanced validation aid, not required family data.

Run the examples from the repository root in the pinned development
environment with `SYMBOLICA_LICENSE` set.

The two root-level K=6 campaign documents exercise separate three-loop foundry
investigation lanes. They are useful bounded search diagnostics, but are not
needed by the completed artifact generation/application examples above:

- [`k6_external_search_hints.toml`](k6_external_search_hints.toml) supplies
  55 reviewed integral-anchor rectangles, a coordinate order, and a modular
  probe portfolio. These are proposal metadata only; RustRed regenerates all
  IBPs and proves every admitted rule itself.
- [`k6_autonomous_campaign.toml`](k6_autonomous_campaign.toml) is the visibly
  separate control. It has no hints object at all, so RustRed derives its
  search program internally.

Both documents are bounded experiments. A successful process exit can still
report `outcome = "incomplete"`; only the exact compiler-closed outcome may
install an in-memory K=6 artifact. On that outcome RustRed deterministically
encodes the artifact, cold-loads and exactly replays it at the untrusted
boundary, and exposes the canonical bytes to the CLI and Python API. An
incomplete campaign never emits artifact bytes.
